<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>For almost 30 years North American herpetologists have been making
extensive collections of reptiles and amphibians in M&eacute;xico. Some parts
of the country, because of their accessibility, soon became relatively
well known; other regions lying off the beaten path were bypassed or
inadequately sampled. Principally in the last decade herpetologists have
been entering regions from which no collections previously were
available in an attempt to fill gaps in known distributions and to
discover unknown species of animals. In 1950 Dr. Donald D. Brand led an
exploration party from the University of Texas to the poorly explored
and faunistically unknown region of southwestern Michoac&aacute;n. James A.
Peters accompanied Brand and collected amphibians and reptiles. In 1951
I welcomed the opportunity to accompany Brand on a second expedition to
southwestern Michoac&aacute;n. Such was the beginning of my interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> in the
herpetofauna of the region. I have been fortunate to return to Michoac&aacute;n
on four successive trips, all of which had as their purpose the
accumulation of data on the herpetofauna that would result in a survey
of the component species and an analysis of their distribution.</p>

<p>My original intention was to amplify Peters' (1954) study based on the
collections made by him in 1950 and by me in 1951 in the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n. But it soon became evident that in order to understand the
relationships of the herpetofauna of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, the
species inhabiting the Tepalcatepec Valley and adjacent mountain ranges
would have to be studied. In the course of making that study I examined
all specimens from Michoac&aacute;n already in museums.</p>

<p>There have been few detailed herpetofaunal studies in M&eacute;xico. The first
such study of any consequence was that by Bogert and Oliver (1945) on
the herpetofauna of Sonora. In that paper the authors analyzed the fauna
from a geographic view and showed the transition from tropical species
in the southern part of the state to members of the Sonoran Desert
assemblage to the north. Martin (1958) made a detailed study of the
herpetofauna of the G&oacute;mez Far&iacute;as region in southern Tamaulipas; he
emphasized the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in
that region with special reference to cloud forests. Duellman (1958c)
presented a preliminary geographic analysis of the herpetofauna of
Colima with special reference to the continuity of the species
inhabiting the lowlands. Zweifel (1960) discussed in detail the
herpetofauna of the Tres Mar&iacute;as Islands and commented on the derivation
of the fauna. Duellman (1960d) provided a detailed account of the
geographic distribution of the amphibians known to occur in the lowlands
of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and attempted to account for the present
patterns of distribution.</p>

<p>The present report is the first of two parts dealing with the
herpetofauna of Michoac&aacute;n. The purpose of this part is to present a full
account of the species of amphibians and reptiles known to inhabit the
state of Michoac&aacute;n; the accounts of the species are accompanied by a
brief description of the natural landscape and of the various
assemblages of species comprising the major faunistic groups within the
region. A gazetteer of collecting localities is appended. The second
part of the study, now in preparation, deals with the ecological and
historical geography of the herpetofauna. Since the present part will be
of interest primarily to systematic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> herpetologists, I have decided to
separate it from the more general material of interest to
biogeographers.</p>

<p>One of the major problems that faces the worker undertaking a faunal
study is the presence of species or genera of unsettled systematic
status. My work in Michoac&aacute;n has been no exception; fifteen separate
studies were undertaken in an attempt to solve systematic problems in
certain groups. Some systematic problems still remain but are of little
consequence insofar as the entire faunal picture is concerned, or are so
involved as to be impractical to undertake at this time. In accounts of
species, such problems are mentioned in the hope that they will interest
some worker who will be inclined to investigate them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acknowledgments</span></h3>

<p>While engaged in the study of the herpetofauna of Michoac&aacute;n I have built
up a debt of gratitude to many individuals, without whose aid my
ambition to complete my study never would have been realized. I am
especially grateful to those individuals who accompanied me in the
field; Lee D. Beatty, Richard E. Etheridge, Carter R. Gilbert, Fred G.
Thompson, Jerome Tulecke, and John Wellman offered stimulating
companionship and valuable assistance. On many occasions they suffered
hardships on behalf of my interests.</p>

<p>Studies of my own specimens have been augmented by material from other
institutions. For permitting me to examine specimens in their care I am
indebted to W. Frank Blair, Charles M. Bogert, Doris M. Cochran, William
B. Davis, James R. Dixon, the late Emmett R. Dunn, Josef Eiselt, Alice
G. C. Grandison, Norman Hartweg, Robert F. Inger, Arthur Loveridge, the
late Karl P. Schmidt, Hobart M. Smith, Robert C. Stebbins, Margaret
Storey, Edward H. Taylor, and Richard G. Zweifel.</p>

<p>Several people have aided me in the study of specimens and in the
analysis of data; I am grateful to Donald D. Brand, who first introduced
me to Michoac&aacute;n; since that time I have benefited much from his
knowledge of the area. James A. Peters provided me with essential
information concerning his field work in southern Michoac&aacute;n in 1950.
James R. Dixon and Floyd L. Downs have permitted me to use freely the
material and data that they accumulated in their recent field work in
Michoac&aacute;n. Norman E. Hartweg allowed me to use the specimens and data
that he gathered in his survey of the herpetofauna in the region of
Volc&aacute;n Par&iacute;cutin. L. C. Stuart, Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> F. Walker, and Richard G.
Zweifel have helped in unraveling some of the systematic and
distributional problems.</p>

<p>I am especially grateful to my wife, Ann, who for six months helped me
track down elusive species and explore new areas. Furthermore, she has
stimulated me to carry this study to completion.</p>

<p>Many people in Michoac&aacute;n favored the field parties with quarters,
transportation, and valuable information, which greatly facilitated the
field work. In this respect I am especially indebted to Ingeniero Ruben
Erbina of Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, who not only let us use his home
as our headquarters, but through a letter of introduction gave us the
"key" to southern Michoac&aacute;n. Ingeniero Pedro Tonda aided us in Arteaga
and San Salvador. Ingeniero Anastacio Per&eacute;z Alfaro of the Comisi&oacute;n
Tepalcatepec in Uruapan provided the latest maps of southern Michoac&aacute;n
and much essential information pertaining to travel conditions in the
area. Se&ntilde;or Nefty Mendoza gave us a home in Dos Aguas; this kindness
allowed us to work in this interesting region during the height of the
rainy season. Mr. and Mrs. Bob Thomas let us make use of their
facilities at Hacienda Zirim&iacute;cuaro. The naval officers at the Estaci&oacute;n
Marina at Playa Azul made pleasant what might have been a dreadful stay
in that small coastal village. To the managers and pilots of Lineas
Aereas Picho in Uruapan I owe special thanks for going out of their way
on more than one occasion to transport a stranded snake-hunter.
Throughout the months of field work beginning in 1955 I constantly have
been aided by the authorities and workers of the Comisi&oacute;n Tepalcatepec,
a subdivision of the Secretaria de Caminos y Obras Publicas, and of the
private corporation, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados. Much of the field
work in Michoac&aacute;n was made possible only through the co-operation of the
natives who supplied mules, acted as guides, and aided in the collection
of specimens. I have learned a great deal from these people. They will
never see this report. Their work as guides, muleteers, and collectors
greatly assisted me with the mountains of equipment that had to be piled
on the backs of scrawny mules for transportation to places where the
natives seldom trod. Their efforts in behalf of Don Guillermo never will
be forgotten; I extend an especially hearty <i>muchas gracias</i> to
Benjamin, Ignacio, Jes&uacute;s, Lorenzo, Mariano, and Remigio.</p>

<p>Much of the work on this report was done while I was associated with the
Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan. I thank Norman E.
Hartweg and T. H. Hubbell for making available<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> to me the facilities of
the museum and for their numerous courtesies that aided me so much.</p>

<h3>Historical Account</h3>

<p>Unlike many parts of southern M&eacute;xico and northern Central America,
Michoac&aacute;n received no attention from the collecting expeditions of the
European museums in the last century. The earliest known herpetological
specimens from Michoac&aacute;n were obtained by Louis John Xantus, who was
appointed U. S. Consul to Colima in 1859. In April, 1863, Xantus
collected at Volc&aacute;n Jorullo in Michoac&aacute;n; in April and May of the same
year he collected along the coast of Michoac&aacute;n between the R&iacute;o Cach&aacute;n
and the R&iacute;o Nexpa. His small collection of 19 extant specimens is in the
United States National Museum. Alfredo Dug&egrave;s, a resident of Guanajuato,
M&eacute;xico, made early contributions to the knowledge of the herpetofauna of
Michoac&aacute;n. In 1885 he described <i>Sonora michoacanensis</i>, and in 1891 he
described <i>Eumeces altamirani</i>; from what is known of the distribution
of these species, he probably had collected in the Tepalcatepec Valley.
During their biological survey of M&eacute;xico, Edward W. Nelson and Edward A.
Goldman spent a limited amount of time in Michoac&aacute;n in 1892 and again in
1903 and 1904. Most of their collecting was done on the plateau in the
north-central part of the state; their collections are in the United
States National Museum. While collecting fishes in southern M&eacute;xico, Seth
E. Meek obtained some amphibians and reptiles from Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro in
1904; these are in the collections of the Chicago Natural History
Museum. In 1908 Hans Gadow ventured into the then unexplored "tierra
caliente" of the Balsas Valley and collected at Volc&aacute;n Jorullo and other
localities in the valley. Later in the same year he collected at
Guayabo, San Salvador, and Arteaga in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and at
Buena Vista and Cofrad&iacute;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> in the Tepalcatepec Valley. His collections
were deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) and the
Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.</p>

<p>The first thirty years of the present century saw little more field work
in Michoac&aacute;n. In the 1930's Edward H. Taylor and Hobart M. Smith
collected throughout much of M&eacute;xico. At various times they worked in
Michoac&aacute;n, principally along the road from M&eacute;xico City to Guadalajara.
In 1935 Hobart M. Smith spent a week at Hacienda El Sabino south of
Uruapan; he revisited the locality again in 1936 and made a large and
important collection of amphibians and reptiles from the upper limits of
the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Specimens
collected by Smith and Taylor were incorporated into the Edward H.
Taylor-Hobart M. Smith collection, which subsequently was deposited in
part in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Illinois and
in part in the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1939 Hobart M. Smith
collected at P&aacute;tzcuaro and between Uruapan and Apatzing&aacute;n; these
collections, made while he was a Walter Rathbone Bacon Scholar of the
Smithsonian Institution, are deposited in the United States National
Museum. In 1940 and 1941 Frederick A. Shannon, who was a member of the
Hoogstraal Expeditions under the auspices of the Chicago Natural History
Museum, collected on Cerro de Tanc&iacute;taro and at Apatzing&aacute;n; an account of
the specimens collected there was published by Schmidt and Shannon
(1947).</p>

<p>The eruption of Volc&aacute;n Par&iacute;cutin in February, 1943, attracted the
attention of many biologists, a group of which from the Museum of
Zoology at the University of Michigan collected in the Cordillera
Volc&aacute;nica in 1945 and 1947. The amphibians and reptiles were collected
and studied by Norman E. Hartweg. In 1950 James A. Peters accompanied
Donald D. Brand on a preliminary exploration of the western part of the
Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and adjacent Pacific coast of Michoac&aacute;n; in the same
year Peters collected also on the Mexican Plateau and at Volc&aacute;n Jorullo.
His specimens are in the Museum of Zoology at the University of
Michigan. Since 1950 many biologists have collected in Michoac&aacute;n in the
course of work on certain groups of animals or in general surveys. In
this way Raymond Alcorn, Robert W. Dickerman, James R. Dixon, Floyd L.
Downs, Emmet T. Hooper, and Robert R. Miller have contributed to our
knowledge of the herpetofauna.</p>

<p>As stated previously, my own field work in Michoac&aacute;n began in 1951, when
I accompanied Donald D. Brand on an exploring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> expedition to the
southern part of the state. In that year a short time was spent on the
Mexican Plateau, principally in the area around Lago de Cuitzeo, and at
Volc&aacute;n Jorullo. In July and August we made our headquarters at
Coalcom&aacute;n. From that town the field party travelled southward to Maruata
on the Pacific coast and thence back over the mountains to Coalcom&aacute;n.
Later in that summer we travelled by mule from Coalcom&aacute;n southeastward
to the mouth of the R&iacute;o Nexpa. In 1955, accompanied by Lee D. Beatty,
Carter R. Gilbert, and Fred G. Thompson, I collected in the Tepalcatepec
Valley and at Coalcom&aacute;n. We made a mule trip from Coalcom&aacute;n to Cerro de
Barolosa, where we made the first collections from the pine-fir forests
in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. Later in the same summer Carter R. Gilbert
and I spent a week at Playa Azul on the Pacific coast. In March, April,
and May, 1956, my wife and I collected for a short time in the
Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica and on the Mexican Plateau. In early April we moved
into the Tepalcatepec Valley, where we collected intensively between
Churumuco and Tepalcatepec. In May we collected on the Pacific coast
between Boca de Apiza and La Placita. In July and August, 1956,
accompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we returned to Michoac&aacute;n and again
collected on the Mexican Plateau and in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, before
moving into the Tepalcatepec Valley. In an attempt to fill in gaps in
the known distributions of many species and to sample the fauna in some
previously uncollected areas, I returned to Michoac&aacute;n in June, 1958.
Accompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John Wellman, I collected on the
Mexican Plateau in the northwestern part of the state, on the southern
slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, and in the Tepalcatepec Valley. Most
of our time was spent in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, where we collected at
Aguililla, Artega, and Dos Aguas. In 1960 two days were spent in
Michoac&aacute;n; a small collection was made in the eastern part of the
Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. With the exception of the specimens collected in
1960, which are at the Museum of Natural History at the University of
Kansas, the specimens that I have collected in Michoac&aacute;n are in the
Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan.</p>

<h2>NATURAL LANDSCAPE</h2>


<p>A proper understanding of the geographical distribution of animals in a
given region is possible only after a thorough acquaintance with the
geography of the region. Likewise, in order to gain a knowledge of the
ecological distribution and relationships of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> components of the
fauna, it is necessary to study the animals in their natural
environments. In order to give the reader a picture of the physical
features and the major animal habitats within the state of Michoac&aacute;n,
the following brief description is offered. Each of these facets
mentioned below will be elaborated in detail in my final report on the
herpetofauna of Michoac&aacute;n.</p>


<h3>Physiography</h3>

<p>The state of Michoac&aacute;n comprises an area of 60,093 square kilometers
(Viv&oacute;, 1953). Within this area the rugged terrain has a total relief of
nearly 4000 meters. There have been several attempts to classify the
physiographic provinces of M&eacute;xico; the classification used here is a
slight modification of the scheme proposed by Tamayo (1949). I have
tried to keep the system as simple as possible, but still useful in
discussing the distribution of animals living in the region. For general
purposes the state of Michoac&aacute;n can be divided into lowlands and
highlands as follows:</p>

<p>Although the lowlands in the state are continuous, they are only
narrowly connected and thus form two distinct physiographic and biotic
areas. The Pacific Coastal Plain in Michoac&aacute;n extends for a distance of
about 200 kilometers (airline) from the R&iacute;o Coahuayana to the R&iacute;o
Balsas. The coastal plain is broad between the R&iacute;o Coahuayana and San
Juan de Lima, and between Las Pe&ntilde;as and the R&iacute;o Balsas, where the hills
rise some 12 kilometers inland from the sea. Between San Juan de Lima
and Las Pe&ntilde;as the mountains extend to the sea; in this region rocky
promontories form precipitous cliffs dropping into the sea. Between the
promontories are small sandy or rocky beaches.</p>

<p>Lying to the north of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and the Sierra del Sur,
but south of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, is a broad structural depression,
the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin. The western part of this basin, which
separates the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n from the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, is the
valley of the R&iacute;o Tepalcatepec, a major tributary of the R&iacute;o Balsas. The
eastern part of the basin is the valley of the R&iacute;o Balsas. From the
point of junction of the two rivers, the R&iacute;o Balsas flows southward
through a narrow gorge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> which separates the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n from
the Sierra del Sur, to the Pacific Ocean. In Michoac&aacute;n the floor of the
Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin varies from 200 to 700 meters above sea level.</p>

<p>The central part of M&eacute;xico is a vast table-land, the Mexican Plateau,
the southern part of which extends into northern Michoac&aacute;n. In this
region the terrain is rolling and varies from 1500 to 1900 meters above
sea level. Many small mountain ranges rise from the plateau and break
the continuity of the rolling table-land. Located on the southern part
of the Mexican Plateau in Michoac&aacute;n are several lakes, the largest of
which are Lago de Chapala, Lago de Cuitzeo, and Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro.</p>

<p>Bordering the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau is a nearly unbroken
chain of volcanos, the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. The highest peaks in
Michoac&aacute;n, Cerro San Andr&eacute;s (3930 meters) and Cerro de Tanc&iacute;taro (3870
meters), are in this range. Parts of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica in
Michoac&aacute;n are known by separate names; these are, from west to east:
Sierra de los Tarascos, Sierra de Ozumatl&aacute;n, and Serran&iacute;a de Ucareo.</p>

<p>Lying between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and east of
the R&iacute;o Coahuayana and west of the R&iacute;o Balsas, is an isolated highland
mass, the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. This mountain range rises to elevations
of slightly more than 3000 meters. It has a length of about 200
kilometers and a width of about 80 kilometers. Except for a relatively
low connection with the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n is
isolated from other mountain ranges in southwestern M&eacute;xico.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Climate</span></h3>

<p>The climates in Michoac&aacute;n vary from tropical in the lowlands to cool
temperate at high elevations in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and Cordillera
Volc&aacute;nica. The highest temperatures are known in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec
Basin, where at Churumuco the mean annual temperature is 29.3&deg; C. and
the range of monthly means is 3.5&deg; C. (Contreras, 1942). Frosts occur
sporadically on the Mexican Plateau, and in the winter snow falls on the
highest mountains.</p>

<p>Precipitation varies geographically and seasonally. Most of the rain
falls between June and October. In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin
rainfall in the rest of the year is negligible. The annual average
rainfall at Coahuayana on the Pacific Coastal Plain is 871 mm.
(Guzm&aacute;n-Rivas, 1957:52). In the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin rainfall
seldom exceeds 800 mm. per year. In the mountains precipitation is
heavier and somewhat more evenly distributed throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> year, but
still definitely cyclic. For example, Uruapan (elevation, 1500 meters)
receives an average annual rainfall of 1674 mm. (Contreras, 1942). The
prevailing winds are from the Pacific Ocean. The southern (windward)
slopes of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n probably receive more rain than any
other part of the state. The Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin lies in a rain
shadow of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, and the Mexican Plateau lies in a
somewhat less drastic rain shadow of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica; these are
the driest regions in the state.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Vegetation and Animal Habitats</span></h3>

<p>For the purposes of this report I have adopted the classification of
types of vegetation that seem to me most significant in terms of
ecological distribution of reptiles and amphibians in Michoac&aacute;n. These
types are as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Temperate</span> (1000-4000 meters)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fir Forest (2400-4000 meters)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pine-oak Forest (1000-4000 meters)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mesquite-grassland (1500-2100 meters)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Tropical</span> (0-1000 meters)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Arid Tropical Scrub Forest (0-1000 meters)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tropical Semi-deciduous Forest (150-600 meters)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The vegetation of the Pacific Coastal Plain and the Balsas-Tepalcatepec
Basin consists of arid tropical scrub forest, composed of deciduous
trees, which in many places are stunted and widely spaced. In the dry
season there is little cover provided by this forest. In the rainy
season there is a sparse growth of grasses and some shade provided by
the small leaves of the thorny trees.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n the rainfall is heaviest on the southern slopes of the
Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and somewhat less so on the southwestern slopes of
the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. At these relatively low elevations (150 to 600
meters) there is tropical semi-deciduous forest, characterized by
relatively dense shade throughout the year and by a leaf mulch on the
ground. This type of forest forms the gallery forest along the larger
streams in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin and on the Pacific Coastal
Plain.</p>

<p>Rainfall also is heavy on the high mountain ridges, where temperatures
are low. On these ridges, fir forest, often mixed with pine and oaks, is
found. This habitat is characterized by a cool, moist climate, many
rotting logs, and a moist ground cover of leaves and needles.</p>

<p>Most of the mountains are covered with pine-oak forest, which in most
places is decidedly subhumid, but where this forest occurs on the
windward sides of high ridges, it sometimes is noticeably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> humid. In
this forest the important animal habitats include the needle- and
leaf-litter, and in some areas, bromeliads.</p>

<p>The rolling terrain of the Mexican Plateau supports cacti, small
leguminous trees, and grasses. Like the arid tropical scrub forest, this
type of vegetation, the Mesquite-grassland association, is deciduous and
thus provides little shelter in the dry season. Unlike the areas in
which arid tropical scrub forest is developed, the Mesquite-grassland is
found in areas having warm days and cool nights.</p>

<h2>GEOGRAPHY OF THE HERPETOFAUNA</h2>


<p>Although the main part of my final report on the herpetofauna of
Michoac&aacute;n will deal with the geographical and ecological patterns of
distribution of the herpetofauna, a brief summary of the faunal
assemblages is presented here.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n there are two major faunal assemblages, one in the
lowlands, and one in the highlands. A large number of the species
inhabiting the lowlands are wide-ranging species, such as <i>Bufo
marinus</i>, <i>Iguana iguana</i>, and <i>Boa constrictor</i>. Sixty-three species
are known to occur on the Pacific Coastal Plain; 41 of these, together
with 36 others occur in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin, a physiographic
region to which several species of reptiles are endemic; for example,
<i>Enyaliosaurus clarki</i>, <i>Urosaurus gadowi</i>, <i>Cnemidophorus calidipes</i>,
and <i>Eumeces altamirani</i>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the members of the highland faunal assemblage have
more restricted geographic ranges. The major exceptions are those
species that are widely distributed on the Mexican Plateau, such as:
<i>Bufo compactilis</i>, <i>Sceloporus torquatus</i>, and <i>Salvadora bairdi</i>. In
the montane habitats of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, 45 species of
amphibians and reptiles are known; 34 species have been found in the
Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. Fourteen species are known to occur in both ranges.
Several species are known only from the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica and
adjacent highlands, and three species are endemic to the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES</h2>


<p>In the following pages the 176 species and subspecies of amphibians and
reptiles known to occur in the state of Michoac&aacute;n are discussed in
relation to their variation, life histories, ecology, and distribution
in the state. Data have been gathered from 9676 specimens. I have not
prolonged the accounts of species with information that has been
presented elsewhere. Consequently, the length and completeness of the
accounts are variable. I have given only the information that I consider
a worthwhile contribution to our knowledge of the particular species.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The synonymies given at the beginning of each account include the first
use of the trivial name by the original author, the first usage of the
combination that I am using, and, if the circumstances make it
necessary, additional names or combinations that have been proposed
since the publication of the checklists of Mexican amphibians and
reptiles by Smith and Taylor (1945, 1948, and 1950b). References cited
only in the synonymies are not listed in the Literature Cited. Preceding
the discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of the localities
in Michoac&aacute;n from which specimens have been examined. The listing of a
locality means that one or more specimens, as indicated, has been
examined from that locality. Only for those specimens especially
mentioned in the text are catalogue numbers given. Abbreviations for the
various museums and scientific collections are, as follows:</p>

Tac&iacute;cuaro (167).</p></div>

<p>Taylor and Smith (1945:530) presented data on 137 specimens collected at
Tac&iacute;cuaro on October 1, 1939; these are all larvae and metamorphosing
individuals. Aside from these, the largest larva examined (UMMZ 104962
from 15 km. W of Morelia) has a snout-vent length of 70.0 mm. and a tail
length of 53.5 mm. The larvae are pale pinkish tan above and somewhat
paler below; there is a lateral row of cream colored spots. The
tail-fin, which is deepest at mid-length, extends to the back of the
head and is flecked with brown. In small larvae the outer edge of the
tail-fin is dark brown. The eyes are large. Two small metamorphosed
specimens (UMMZ 98967) from 24 kilometers south of P&aacute;tzcuaro are
tentatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> referred to this species. These specimens have body lengths
of 49.0 and 45.0 mm. and tail lengths of 36.0 and 31.5 mm.,
respectively. They have 17-17 and 16-15 vomerine teeth arranged in a
broad arch behind the choanae, 10 costal grooves, and 7 intercostal
spaces between adpressed toes. The dorsal color is uniform brown; that
of the venter is a dusty cream.</p>

<p>Larvae were collected from shallow ponds near Quiroga and 15 kilometers
west of Morelia; metamorphosed individuals were taken from beneath logs
in pine and fir forests at elevations from 2300 to 2800 meters.</p>

<p>For many years this unusual salamander was known from only a few
specimens mostly collected in the last century; Smith and Taylor
(1948:7) stated: "It is presumed that this species is extinct owing to
the introduction of exotic game and food fishes." In 1951 and in 1955 I
had been told that <i>axolotls</i> were sold in the market at P&aacute;tzcuaro;
nevertheless, none was found on my visits there. In 1956 Charles M.
Bogert obtained several large specimens at the market in P&aacute;tzcuaro.
These establish the continued existence of the salamander in Lago de
P&aacute;tzcuaro. On January 27, 1955, R. W. Dickerman procured a specimen (KU
41573) in the market at Morelia. Since fish are brought to Morelia from
Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro, the specimen probably was from that lake.
Nevertheless, the species may occur in other permanent bodies of water
in Michoac&aacute;n. Maldonado-Koerdell (1948) described <i>Bathysiredon dumerili
queretarensis</i> from San Juan del R&iacute;o, Queretaro. This locality is about
200 airline kilometers northeast of Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro and is in the R&iacute;o
Moctezuma drainage.</p>

<p>Of 16 specimens (KU 51520-35) collected on June 18, 1955, near San
Gregorio, 15 are adult females with swollen cloacae and minute ovarian
eggs. Possibly these specimens had just recently deposited their mature
eggs. In preservative the specimens are black above and dull creamy gray
below. Measurements for the 15 females are: snout-vent length,
80.0-102.0 (92.5); tail length, 69.0-93.0 (84.2); head width, 15.8-20.5
(17.7); head length, 22.8-26.6 (24.4). A larval specimen with small
gills has a snout-vent length of 72 mm. and a tail length of 62 mm.
Three specimens have 12 costal grooves; the other have 11.</p>

<p>Of 20 specimens from San Jos&eacute; de la Cumbre (UMMZ 112857 and 115143), 14
are neotenic adults; the others are larvae. In life the salamanders were
blackish to olive-brown above with scattered cream-colored dots on the
dorsum and flanks but in preservative are dull grayish black with
indistinct pale spots and dark reticulations. The belly is pale gray
with indistinct dark spots. Eleven females and three males have the
following measurements, respectively: snout-vent length, 76.0-90.0
(80.7), 64.0-84.0 (74.3); tail length, 70.0-81.0 (75.0), 58.0-71.0
(66.7); head width, 19.5-23.5 (20.7), 17.5-20.5 (19.3); head length,
22.0-25.0 (23.0), 20.0-22.5 (21.5). The smallest larva has a snout-vent
length of 43.0 mm. and a tail length of 38.0 mm. Two individuals have 12
costal grooves; the others have 11. All of the females contained eggs,
the largest of which were 1.5 mm. in diameter. The stomachs of most of
the specimens were distended with oligochaets, aquatic insect larvae,
and small aquatic beetles.</p>

<p>A series of 34 larvae (JRD 5904-37) from 46 kilometers east of Morelia
are tentatively referred to this species. These specimens are
olive-brown above with cream-colored spots on the flanks; the dorsal
tail-fin does not extend onto the body.</p>

<p>This species has been found only at elevations in excess of 2400 meters
in pine and fir forests. At Rancho Axolotl James A. Peters collected
larvae and neotenic individuals in a rocky stream and adults from
beneath rocks and logs in the forest near the stream. Neotenic
individuals and larvae were found in a clear stream in pine-fir forest
at an elevation of 2700 meters near San Jos&eacute; de la Cumbre; specimens
were collected there in July, 1955, and again in July, 1956. The site
was visited in April, 1956, at which time the stream consisted of only a
few puddles; no salamanders were found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Definite specific assignment of these specimens, all larvae, cannot be
made at this time. They have shovel-shaped heads and laterally
compressed bodies with the dorsal tail-fin extending anteriorly to the
back of the head. The eyes are small. The body is pale tan with dark
mottling on the tail and flanks. The average snout-vent length for nine
specimens from Tac&iacute;cuaro is 61.0 mm.</p>

<p>The larvae from Tac&iacute;cuaro (UMMZ 89255) were collected by Dyfrig Forbes
in October, 1939; those from P&aacute;tzcuaro, presumably Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro
(BMNH 1914.1.28-247-8 and CNHM 948), were collected by Hans Gadow and

<p>This salamander seems to reach its greatest abundance in Michoac&aacute;n in
the Sierra de los Tarascos between P&aacute;tzcuaro and Tanc&iacute;taro, where it is
found at elevations from 1500 to 2900 meters. It is found less commonly
in the eastern part of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica in Michoac&aacute;n, where it
sometimes occurs in association with <i>Pseudoeurycea robertsi</i>.</p>

<p>On June 22 and 23, 1955, four clutches of eggs of this species were
found beneath adobe bricks and rocks on the volcanic ash that has buried
the village of San Juan de Parangaricutiro. The eggs were unstalked and
separate, but adherent in clumps of three or four (Pl. 2, Fig. 1). The
outer membranes were covered with fine particles of ash. The ash beneath
the stones where the eggs were found was only slightly moist; one clump
of eggs was partially desiccated. Three complete clutches have 20, 23,
and 34 eggs; one clutch of 15 eggs was being eaten by beetles
(Tenebrionidae: <i>Eleodes</i> sp.). The eggs vary in size from 4.6 to 6.5
mm. and average 5.3 mm. in diameter. They are unpigmented. Surrounding
the embryo is a vitelline membrane, an inner, and an outer envelope
(Fig. 1). In an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> average-sized egg having an embryo 4 mm. in length, the
diameter of the outer membrane is 5.3 mm., the inner membrane 5.0 mm.,
and the vitelline membrane 4.6 mm. All of the eggs contained embryos in
which the limb buds were developed; in about half of these the eyes were
distinctly visible.</p>

</div>

<p>The first heavy rain of the season occurred on the night of June 22,
1955. Thus, at least sometimes, <i>Pseudoeurycea belli</i> lays its eggs
before the onset of the rainy season. A female having a snout-vent
length of 110 mm., collected on June 22, 1955, contained 36 ovarian eggs
having diameters from 3.0 to 3.5 mm. The fact that small juveniles were
collected on the same date indicates that this salamander lays eggs over
a period of several weeks in late spring and early summer.</p>

<p>The smallest juvenile examined has a snout-vent length of 17.0 mm. and a
tail length of 7.5 mm. Twelve juveniles from the vicinity of San Juan de
Parangaricutiro have an average snout-vent length of 19.4 mm. and an
average tail length of 9.7 mm. In juveniles the adpressed limbs either
touch or overlap by one intercostal space; in adults there are two or
three intercostal spaces between adpressed toes. Therefore the greatest
number of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs is found in the
largest specimens. A similar relationship between adpressed limbs (=
length of limbs) and snout-vent length was shown for <i>Plethodon
richmondi</i> by Duellman (1954a). The number of vomerine teeth is
variable; the number of teeth seems to be closely correlated with the
size of the salamander (Fig. 2). A similar correlation between the
number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> maxillary teeth and body length was reported for
<i>Chiropterotriton multidentatus</i> by Rabb (1958). In 12 juvenile
<i>Pseudoeurycea belli</i> there are 6-13 (8.8) vomerine teeth, and in 11
adults having snout-vent lengths greater than 90 mm. there are 39-49
(44.0) vomerine teeth. The coloration of the juveniles resembles that of
the adults (Pl. 1).</p>

<p>The differences between this species and <i>Pseudoeurycea gigantea</i> are
minor. Taylor (1939a) distinguished <i>gigantea</i> from <i>belli</i> by the
larger size, fewer intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs, more
vomerine teeth, and absence of occipital spots in <i>gigantea</i>. Taylor and
Smith (1945) stated that in life the spots in <i>gigantea</i> are orange
instead of red as in <i>belli</i>. Five specimens of <i>Pseudoeurycea belli</i>
from Michoac&aacute;n, including one juvenile, lack occipital spots. In the 34
living individuals that I have seen from Michoac&aacute;n the spots varied from
deep red to orange. Therefore, of the characters listed by Taylor (<i>op.
cit.</i>) to diagnose <i>Pseudoeurycea gigantea</i>, only the over-all larger
size and smaller number of intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs (=
relatively longer limbs) are useful in separating <i>Pseudoeurycea belli</i>
and <i>gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>Previously this species has been recorded only from the type locality.
In July, 1956, individuals referable to this species were found at two
sites in pine-fir forest immediately to the east of Macho de Agua and in
pine-oak-fir forest at Atzimba. On August 20, 1958,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> a series was
collected in pine-fir forest at Puerto Lengua de Vaca. These localities
are between 2900 and 3000 meters in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica in eastern
Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p>In life the coloration of these salamanders was highly variable. The
belly and undersurfaces of the tail and hind limbs were pale gray, with
or without silvery white flecks; the chin was a cream-color and flecked
with silvery white in some specimens. The middorsal area was brown,
orange-brown, or dull grayish yellow. The flanks and lateral surfaces of
the tail were black with yellowish flecks or streaks on the flanks and
yellowish or orange-brown flecks on the tail. The iris was golden brown.
Measurements of eight males and two females are, respectively:
snout-vent length, 42.5-56.0 (49.5), 54.0-60.0 (57.0); tail length,
42.0-56.0 (48.1), 52.0-55.0 (53.5). The smallest juvenile has a
snout-vent length of 28.0 mm. and a tail length of 23.0 mm. Of the 26
available specimens, six have 12 costal grooves, and the others have 11.</p>

<p>In comparison with 36 topotypes, the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n have a
less striking dorsal color pattern; none has a well-defined dorsal
reddish brown area or bold reddish mottling on the tail. Furthermore,
the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n have paler venters than do topotypic
specimens.</p>

<p>These specimens (BMNH 1914.1.28.181-90) were collected by Gadow in 1908
and reported by him (1930:72): "Whilst this very sluggish termite-eating
toad is common enough in the sweltering hot country of the state of Vera
Cruz, up to an elevation of 1500 feet, it was unknown on the west side
of the Isthmus until I found it in great numbers near the mouth of the
Balsas River, in and near fresh-water pools, where it attracted
attention by its loud peculiar voice during the pairing season in the
month of July." Subsequently, Peters (1954:3) verified the
identification of these specimens. Although torrential rains fell during
the week in July, 1955, that I spent at Playa Azul near the mouth of the
R&iacute;o Balsas, the distinctive voice of <i>Rhinophrynus</i> was not heard.
Elsewhere on the Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico adult <i>Rhinophrynus</i> have been
reported only from Tehuantepec and a few localities on the coastal
lowlands of Chiapas. Taylor (1942b:37) found on the coast of Guerrero a
tadpole that was referred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> to the genus <i>Rhinophrynus</i> by Orton (1943).
In the summer of 1960 adults of <i>Rhinophrynus</i> were collected near
Acapulco, Guerrero (Fouquette, <i>in litt.</i>). These recent collections
verify the existence of the species along the Pacific lowlands of M&eacute;xico
at least as far north as Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p>This small toad has been found at elevations between 1500 and 2500
meters on the Mexican Plateau and associated mountain ranges; it occurs
in mesquite-grassland and in pine forests. Calling males and females
laden with eggs have been collected in the rainy season in the months of
July and August. The call is a medium-pitched snore. In living
individuals the dorsal ground color varies from pale brown to gray with
dark brown or olive-brown markings. In many individuals the tips of the
small dorsal pustules are red.</p>

<p>Apatzing&aacute;n (27); Lombardia; Nueva Italia (5).</p></div>

<p>In life the dorsal color pattern consists of a yellowish tan ground
color with dark brown spots; the middorsal stripe is deep yellow or
cream color. The venter is a dusty cream color, and the iris is pale
gold. Males have dark brown horny nuptial tuberosities on the thumb. The
following measurements are of 21 males and four females, respectively:
snout-vent length, 43.5-51.7 (48.1), 55.6-62.6 (59.1); tibia length,
16.6-18.8 (17.6), 18.8-20.3 (19.3); head width, 16.7-19.7 (18.4),
20.6-22.2 (21.4); head length, 13.8-16.6 (14.8), 16.5-18.2 (17.3).</p>

<p>The specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley differ slightly from
specimens from southeastern M&eacute;xico and Central America. Those from
Michoac&aacute;n have low and narrow cranial crests; in about one-half of the
specimens the occipital crest exists only as a row of tubercles, and in
some the postorbital and suborbital crests are barely discernible.
Specimens from the southern part of the range, Costa Rica and Nicaragua,
have much higher and thicker cranial crests; in these the occipital
crest is well defined and extends posteriorly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> to a point back of the
anterior edge of the parotid gland; the postorbital and suborbital
crests are well marked. Of 48 specimens from Esquipulas, Guatemala, all
have high crests, but these are not so well developed as in ten
specimens from Matagalpa, Nicaragua, and three from various localities
in Costa Rica. Six specimens from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, have cranial
crests that are lower than those in specimens from Guatemala. In three
of the specimens from Tehuantepec the occipital crests are reduced to a
series of tubercles. Of six specimens from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero,
four have poorly developed occipital crests. These observations suggest
the presence of a cline in the development of the cranial crests;
specimens have higher crests in the southern part of the range than in
the northern part.</p>

<p>In M&eacute;xico <i>Bufo coccifer</i> has been collected only in semi-xeric
habitats, but to the south, from Guatemala to Costa Rica, it has been
found in more upland and humid habitats. Southern specimens are darker
than those from the north, a possible correlation with the differences
in habitat.</p>

<p>These toads probably range throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley, but they
are unknown from the coast of Michoac&aacute;n. Breeding choruses were found
after heavy rains on June 24, 1955, and on August 2, 1956. The first was
in a muddy ditch; the second was in a flooded grassy field. The call is
a high-pitched, but not loud, "whirrr." Males were calling from the edge
of the water or from clumps of grass in the water. Clasping pairs were
in the water; amplexus is axillary.</p>

<p>This large toad is characteristically found in areas supporting tropical
scrub forest to elevations of about 1000 meters. The species is much
more abundant than the numbers listed above suggest. In the dry season
individuals have been observed in patios, along streams, and by
irrigation ditches. In the rainy season the loud, rattling call of the
males is heard at night throughout the Tepalcatepec Valley and the
coastal lowlands.</p>

<p>Taylor and Smith (1945:552) revived Wiegmann's <i>Bufo horribilis</i> for the
large toads of M&eacute;xico that are here referred to <i>B. marinus</i>. Their
action was based upon the supposition that the "species <i>marinus</i>" is
composite. Although probably true, this supposition has yet to be
proved. Until the large, and apparently related, species of <i>Bufo</i>
inhabiting tropical America have been studied systematically as a unit,
the recognition of segments of the population as either species or
subspecies is meaningless. Taylor and Smith (op. cit.:553) based the
description of a new species, <i>Bufo angustipes</i>, on one rather
emaciated, formalin-hardened female from La Esperanza, Chiapas. The type
(USNM 116513), when compared with numerous specimens of <i>Bufo marinus</i>
from throughout the range of the species in M&eacute;xico and northern Central
America, displays no combination of characters to set it off from the
others. Therefore, I suggest that <i>Bufo horribilis</i> Wiegmann and <i>Bufo
angustipes</i> Taylor and Smith be placed in the synonymy of <i>Bufo marinus</i>
(Linnaeus) until future systematic study of the genus and this species
in particular establishes the existence of recognizable taxa.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species is confined to elevations of less than 1000
meters on the coast and foothills of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> In this
region in the months of June and July, breeding congregations have been
found in temporary pools and along streams.</p>

<p>Smith and Taylor (1948:39), in their key to the Mexican species of
<i>Bufo</i>, placed emphasis on the nature of the supraorbital and
postorbital crests (whether they form a curve or a sharp angle) in
distinguishing <i>Bufo marmoreus</i> from <i>Bufo perplexus</i>. In the original
description of <i>perplexus</i>, Taylor (1943a:347) characterized the species
as follows: supraorbital and postorbital crests forming a sharp angle,
instead of a curve as in <i>marmoreus</i>; supratympanic crest smaller than
in <i>marmoreus</i>; diagonal lateral stripe lacking in females;
concentration of dorsal tubercles as found in <i>marmoreus</i> lacking in
males. The discovery of specimens in which the crests form a curve and
others in which the crests form an angle in both the Tepalcatepec Valley
and in the coastal lowlands prompted an investigation of these
characters and others throughout the ranges of the species. An
examination of 410 specimens has resulted in the following conclusions.</p>

<p>5. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin usually have a
broad middorsal line that is yellow or pale tan; those from
outside the basin have either a narrow middorsal line or
none.</p>

<p>6. Males from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin have low,
scattered dorsal tubercles (Fig. 3); males from outside the
basin have a concentration of tubercles in a broad band on
the back (Fig. 4).</p></div>

<p>Therefore the nature of the cranial crests is of little value in
separating two populations, but the color pattern of the females and the
nature of the dorsal tubercles of the males do show distinct
differences. Furthermore, certain differences in size and proportion are
evident; <i>Bufo marmoreus</i> is a slightly larger toad and has a relatively
longer tibia and longer head than <i>perplexus</i> (Table 2).</p>

<p>Taylor (1943a:347) described <i>Bufo perplexus</i> from Mexcala on the R&iacute;o
Balsas in Guerrero. Among the many paratypes are specimens from Tonol&aacute;,
Chiapas, and Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. These apparently were referred to
<i>perplexus</i> solely on the nature of the cranial crests. All of the
specimens examined during the course of the present study from the
lowlands of Veracruz and from the Pacific lowlands from Sinaloa
southward to Chiapas are referable to <i>Bufo marmoreus</i>; those from the
Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin are referable to <i>Bufo perplexus</i>, as defined
above. Ten specimens from Chilpancingo, Guerrero (UMMZ 115352), do not
readily fit either species. Perhaps there is gene exchange between the
inland and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> coastal populations through the relatively low pass at
Chilpancingo, at the mouth of the R&iacute;o Balsas, and near the convergent
headwaters of the R&iacute;o Coahuayana and R&iacute;o Tepalcatepec in southern
Jalisco. If this can be demonstrated, then <i>Bufo perplexus</i> would have
to be considered as a subspecies of <i>Bufo marmoreus</i>, instead of an
allopatric species.</p>

<p>This toad is an inhabitant of pine and oak forests between 900 and 2400
meters. Near Charapendo on the slopes of the Sierra de los Tarascos and
at Coalcom&aacute;n it apparently reaches its lowest altitudinal limits. At
both of these localities the pine-oak forest is replaced by arid
tropical scrub forest on the lower slopes.</p>

<p>Twenty-four tadpoles were collected on May 3 in a quiet section of a
fast stream near Barranca Seca. The tadpoles have a robust body,
broadest about two-thirds the distance from the snout to the posterior
edge of the body, half again as broad as deep. Eyes dorsolateral;
nostrils dorsal, somewhat directed forward, and about three-fifths the
distance from the tip of the snout to the eye; spiracle sinistral and
lateral, located at about midbody; anus median; tail long and slender;
tail-musculature extends nearly to tip of tail; depth of
tail-musculature at mid-length about one-third total depth of tail;
dorsal tail-fin not extending onto body (Fig. 5); average body length of
ten tadpoles having small hind limb buds, 14.4 mm.; average tail length,
22.0 mm.</p>

<p>Mouth ventral, nearly terminal, about one-third as wide as widest part
of body; anterior lip has no papillae; lower lip bordered by two rows of

sometimes broken (Fig. 6).</p>

<p>The body is black dorsally and laterally, and bluish gray ventrally; the
tail musculature is brown and stippled with darker brown. The fins are
transparent and stippled with brown, the stippling being most pronounced
on the posterior two-thirds of the upper tail-fin.</p>

<p>The relationships of this toad seem to be with <i>Bufo bocourti</i> Brocchi,
an inhabitant of pine and oak forests in the uplands of Chiapas and
Guatemala. In <i>Bufo occidentalis</i> the tympanum usually is indistinct and
sometimes completely covered, and it is absent in <i>bocourti</i>. <i>Bufo
occidentalis</i> has a broader interorbital area and relatively shorter and
more rounded parotid glands than <i>bocourti</i>. The tadpoles of the two

<p>This species is widespread in the lowlands of the state; it has been
collected up to elevations of 1050 meters in the Tepalcatepec Valley. In
the dry season individuals were discovered beneath rocks along streams
and in damp arroyos; in the rainy season they were found wherever there
was water. Males were heard calling from flooded fields, ditches, rocky
streams, and small puddles. The call is a series of individual notes:
"woink, woink, woink."</p>

<p>Adult males are noticeably smaller than females; measurements for 20
males and ten females from Apatzing&aacute;n are, respectively: snout-vent

<p>Five km. W of Tangamandapio.</p></div>

<p>On the night of June 11, 1958, this species was calling from a
hyacinth-choked ditch. Although numerous individuals were heard, only
one specimen was obtained. The frogs were calling from the tangled mat
of hyacinths along with <i>Hyla eximia</i>, <i>Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis</i>, and
<i>Rana pipiens</i>.</p>

<p>Taylor (1936a:352) characterized this species as follows: "The narrow
head, small maximum size (38 mm. for females, 33 mm. for males), the
character of the postaxillary and postfemoral glands, the narrower
groups of vomerine teeth, clearly distinguish this western Mexican form
from the more robust, larger <i>melanonotus</i> to the south. The call is
likewise fainter and different in quality." Concerning the glands,
Taylor (<i>loc. cit.</i>) remarked: "There is a possibility that the horny
excrescence covering the glands may appear only during the breeding
season. This character is quite as strongly marked in females as in
males." Bogert and Oliver (1945:324) concluded that the population of
<i>Leptodactylus</i> in northwestern M&eacute;xico could not be distinguished from
<i>melanonotus</i> in other parts of the country and thus synonymized
<i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i> with <i>melanonotus</i>. Bogert and Oliver (op.
cit.: 324) stated that the extent as well as the presence or absence of
ventral glands was highly variable in all samples examined by them.</p>

<p>Upon seeing numerous living individuals of <i>Leptodactylus melanonotus</i>
from many parts of its range in M&eacute;xico and individuals of the population
of <i>Leptodactylus</i> in northwestern M&eacute;xico (Nayarit and Sinaloa), I was
immediately impressed not so much by the differences in the development
of the ventral glands, but by the color of the glands. The differences
in color are apparent in freshly preserved specimens. With the exception
of <i>Leptodactylus</i> from northwestern M&eacute;xico, specimens of <i>melanonotus</i>
from throughout M&eacute;xico and northern Central America have yellow or
yellowish brown glands. Specimens from northwestern M&eacute;xico have black or
brownish black glands that are conspicuously darker than those found in
<i>melanonotus</i>. Examination of 653 preserved specimens of <i>Leptodactylus
melanonotus</i> from M&eacute;xico and Guatemala has failed to reveal specimens
with black ventral glands, like those found in specimens from
northwestern M&eacute;xico, to which the name <i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i> has
been applied. Furthermore, in <i>melanonotus</i> the glands are less distinct
and more extensive than in <i>occidentalis</i>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> in the latter species glands
are absent from the throat and midventral area, where they often are
present in <i>melanonotus</i> (Fig. 7).</p>

<p>In some individuals of both species collected in the dry season and in
some collected in the rainy (breeding) season the glands are absent; the
development of these glands, therefore, does not seem to be correlated
with breeding. Likewise, the glands are present or absent in either sex,
and often as not they are present in juveniles. Presence of the glands,
therefore, cannot be correlated either with sexual or ontogenetic
development. Since the glands are found in individuals from all parts of
the range, it is unlikely that there is a correlation between the
development of the glands and the environment.</p>

</div>

<p>Aside from the differences in the ventral glands, the call is different
in the two populations. The call of <i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i> is a
rather harsh "wack, wack, wack" as contrasted with the more nasal
"woink, woink, woink" of <i>melanonotus</i>. Sound spectrographs are needed
to analyze the differences in calls. None of the specimens of
<i>occidentalis</i> examined approaches in size the largest individuals of
<i>melanonotus</i>; possibly the size of the frogs is another valid character
for separating the species. On the basis of the above data it is evident
that the frogs in northwestern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> M&eacute;xico show certain characters that
distinguish them from <i>Leptodactylus melanonotus</i>, as it is known
throughout the rest of M&eacute;xico. It is not known for certain that
<i>melanonotus</i> and <i>occidentalis</i> are sympatric. Several series of old,
poorly preserved specimens from Nayarit and Sinaloa cannot be placed in
either species, for none has visible ventral glands. <i>Leptodactylus
melanonotus</i> is known from Acaponeta, Nayarit (AMNH 43913-25), and the
following localities in Jalisco: Barro de Navidad (UMMZ 118098), La
Concepci&oacute;n (UMMZ 113081), La Resolana (UMMZ 102104), and Tenachitl&aacute;n
(UMMZ 113045-6). Records for <i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i> are: &Aacute;lamos,
Sonora (AMNH 51356-65); Culiac&aacute;n (AMNH 49511-9), Chele (UMMZ 110914),
and Rosario (UMMZ 113062) in Sinaloa; Ixtl&aacute;n del R&iacute;o (UMMZ 102108), San
Blas (UMMZ 112814, 112994, 110892, 115543), and Tepic (UMMZ 115544) in
Nayarit; Ameca (UMMZ 102106-7) and La Cofrad&iacute;a on the south shore of
Lago de Chapala (UMMZ 102105) in Jalisco; and Tangamandapio, Michoac&aacute;n
(UMMZ 119145). From these scattered records it appears that
<i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i> in the southern part of its range stays in
the uplands, whereas <i>melanonotus</i> is confined to the lowlands.</p>

<p>This large series (UMMZ 119247-8) was collected on June 22 and 23, 1958,
before the onset of the heavy summer rains. The frogs were found in a
shaded ravine at the north edge of Arteaga; they were obtained during
the day, at which time they were actively moving about in the leaf
litter along a small stream.</p>

<p>These frogs are all referred to <i>M. pygmaeus</i>, because this is the
earliest name available for frogs showing the variation in
characteristics displayed by this large series. The characters used by
Taylor (1936a, 1940d, 1941a, and 1942b) and Smith and Taylor (1948) to
distinguish the various species of <i>Microbatrachylus</i> include color
pattern, relative length of the hind limb, presence and position of
dorsal dermal folds or pustules, relative size of inner and outer
metatarsal tubercles, and the number of palmar tubercles. All specimens
from Arteaga have two palmar tubercles; the inner and outer metatarsal
tubercles are subequal in size. Furthermore, aside from sexual
difference, there is little variation in the relative length of the hind
limbs (Table 3). However, many color patterns do exist in the series;

<p>A.&mdash;225 specimens: Dorsum mottled brown and cream, usually with a dark
spot between the eyes and one or two dark V-shaped marks with the apex
anteriorly on the back; 55 of these have a narrow cream-colored line
from the tip of the snout to the vent and thence onto the posterior
surfaces of the thighs. All are pustulate above; in most specimens the
pustules form no pattern, but in some they tend to form a V in the
scapular region.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;41 specimens: Dorsum pale tan or cream-color with brown mottling on
flanks; a brown interorbital bar and a brown chevron in scapular region.
Dorsum irregularly pustulate; in some specimens the pustules tend to
form a V in the scapular region.</p>

<p>C.&mdash;12 specimens: Dorsum colored like "A", but having a broad yellow
stripe narrowly bordered by black from the tip of the snout to the vent;
in some specimens there is a narrow yellow stripe on the posterior
surfaces of the thighs. The dorsum is irregularly pustulate.</p>

<p>D.&mdash;31 specimens: Dorsum variably streaked with cream-color or pale tan
and brown; usually a broad cream-colored stripe from eyelid to groin
bordered laterally by a somewhat narrower brown stripe; middorsal area
cream-color and separated from dorsolateral cream-colored stripe by a
brown stripe, or middorsal area brown with a cream-colored or yellow,
narrow stripe from tip of snout to vent; a dark stripe from tympanum to
flank; dorsal surfaces of heels creamy white to pale orange; anal patch
brown. A dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump; another
ridge extends posteromedially from the eyelid; scattered pustules on the
dorsum in some specimens.</p>

<p>E.&mdash;17 specimens: A narrow dark stripe from snout, through nostril and
eye, over tympanum, to vent, enclosing a unicolor dorsum (reddish tan to
yellowish tan in life); heels pale tan or yellow above; anal patch
black. A faint dermal ridge from posterior edge of eyelid to rump, or
part way to rump.</p>

<p>F.&mdash;2 specimens: Mottled brown and cream-color above; upper lips and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

scattered pustules on dorsum.</p>

<p>Some of these color variants are assignable to names proposed by Taylor:
"A" and "B" undoubtedly are <i>M. pygmaeus</i> (Taylor, 1936a); "C" probably
is <i>M. pygmaeus</i>; "D" is referable to <i>M. minimus</i> (Taylor, 1940d) in
most characteristics, although the coloration is more nearly like that
of <i>M. lineatissimus</i> (Taylor, 1941a), a larger species characterized by
a relatively long hind limb; "E" apparently is <i>M. imitator</i> (Taylor,
1942b); "F" is <i>M. albolabris</i> (Taylor, 1940d). Examination of series of
these frogs from other parts of M&eacute;xico shows a similar composition of
color variants. Of 78 specimens from the R&iacute;o Sarabia and the village of
Sarabia in Oaxaca (UMMZ 115428-37), 57 are "A," six are "D," three are
"E," and 12 are "F"; of 22 specimens from Teapa, Tabasco (UMMZ 113829),
11 are "A," five are "D," two are "E," and four are "F"; of 33 specimens
from Potrero Viejo, Veracruz (USNM 115447-58, 115461-71, 116840-2,
116864-70), ten are "A," 13 are "E," and ten are "F"; of 31 specimens
from La Esperanza, Chiapas (USNM 115477-9, 116827-39, 116849-63), 28 are
"A" and four are "F."</p>

<p>It is highly doubtful if these color variants are actually distinct
species. Goin (1950 and 1954) in his studies of inheritance of color
pattern in West Indian species of the genus <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> has
shown that similar color pattern variants come from the same clutch of
eggs; furthermore, Goin has worked out the genetic ratios of certain of
these variants. Heathwole (<i>in litt.</i>) obtained "normal" specimens and
individuals having a broad middorsal stripe ("C" in figure 9) from a
clutch of eggs of <i>Eleutherodactylus gollmeri</i>. The presence of a broad
middorsal yellow stripe is common in <i>Eleutherodactylus rugulosus</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of variability in color pattern in
Mexican eleutherodactylids is the parallelism between members of the
<i>Eleutherodactylus rhodopis</i>-group and some members of
<i>Microbatrachylus</i>. In the former group there are white-lipped
individuals (<i>Eleutherodactylus beatae</i> Boulenger), individuals having a
unicolor reddish or yellowish dorsum (<i>E. dorsoconcolor</i> Taylor), and
individuals having a dorsal pattern of irregular longitudinal brown and
cream-colored streaks (<i>E. venustus</i> G&uuml;nther). In the humid forests of
southern Veracruz, northern Oaxaca, and Chiapas members of both groups
occur sympatrically. A proper understanding of the evolutionary
significance of these variants in the two groups, as well as proper
allocation of the presently recognized species, must await experimental
evidence based on studies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> of the inheritance of color pattern.
Nevertheless, at present it is apparent that certain characters,
especially the nature of the dermal folds and pustules, and the color
pattern, are of little taxonomic value in distinguishing "species" of
<i>Microbatrachylus</i>. The data derived from a study of the large series
from Arteaga, together with that from the other series examined,
suggests that <i>Microbatrachylus albolabris</i>, <i>imitator</i>, <i>minimus</i>, and
<i>pygmaeus</i> are morphotypes of one species. Of these names, <i>pygmaeus</i> is
the oldest. Consequently <i>Microbatrachylus pygmaeus</i> has been used here
for the series from Arteaga.</p>

<p>Although <i>Microbatrachylus hobartsmithi</i>, a species distinguished from
all of the above by the presence of tubercles on the outer edge of the
tarsus, is known from Michoac&aacute;n northward into Nayarit,
<i>Microbatrachylus pygmaeus</i> previously has not been known north of
Guerrero, where it occurs in habitats similar to that in which it was
collected at Arteaga.</p>

<p>The few specimens indicate that this species occurs at moderate to high
elevations in the state. The specimens from Cher&aacute;n and Uruapan were
obtained in pine forests; the specimen from Coalcom&aacute;n was found on a
rocky hillside covered with dense forest and located about 100 meters
below the lower limits of the pine forest in the area. A specimen from
Rancho Reparto (elevation 1850 meters) on the west slope of Cerro
Barolosa was lost.</p>

<p>The specimen from Coalcom&aacute;n (UMMZ 104728) is a juvenile having a
snout-vent length of 25.0 mm. In life it was tan above, mottled with
olive-green. The ventral surfaces were gray; the hind limbs were
distinctly barred with yellow and brown, and the lips were barred with
yellow and black.</p>

<p>The locality records for this species suggest that it is a member of a
group of animals, the distribution of which includes the western part of
the Mexican Plateau and the Pacific lowlands. In Michoac&aacute;n<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> this frog
has been collected in pine-oak forest at Cascada Tzararacua and at Los
Reyes, in arid scrub forest at Arteaga and Coalcom&aacute;n, and in tropical
semi-deciduous forest on the lower Pacific slopes of the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n. On July 5, 1950, James Peters (1954:6) found calling males at
La Placita.</p>

<p>Most of the specimens are immature; four adult males have snout-vent
lengths of 30.9-33.0 (32.2) mm. In all specimens the first finger is
noticeably longer than the second; the inner metatarsal tubercle is
large, flat, and cream-colored, contrasting with the dark brown sole of
the foot. When the hind limbs are adpressed, the heels broadly overlap.
Characteristically, a dark line extends from the snout, through the eye,
above the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of the forelimb.
Usually there is a dark bar behind the tympanum, two dark brown bars
from the eye to the mouth and thence onto the lower jaw, and another
dark bar on the upper lip between the eye and nostril. One adult from
Arteaga, an adult and a juvenile from La Placita, and one juvenile each
from Coire, Ostula, and P&oacute;maro, have the lower lip barred with dark
brown and white, and have a white stripe extending the length of the
upper lip. In life the dorsum varies from dark gray or olive-brown to
tan or reddish brown.</p>

<p>This species belongs to a group containing two other populations that
are currently recognized as species&mdash;<i>calcitrans</i>, known only from
Omiltemi, Guerrero, and <i>mexicanus</i>, reported from the mountains of
Oaxaca. Another apparently undescribed member of this group has been
collected in the mountains of northern Puebla. The locality records
indicate that the group inhabits the mountains on the periphery of the
Mexican Plateau, except in western M&eacute;xico, where <i>Eleutherodactylus
occidentalis</i> extends to the Pacific lowlands.</p>

inhabits riparian situations in arroyos and canyons in the lower slopes
of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica and the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, where it has
been taken at elevations only below 1100 meters.</p>

<p>The dorsal color of living individuals from Arteaga varied from dark
gray and olive brown to tan and reddish brown. The iris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> was grayish
brown. In contrast, individuals from Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, had pale
golden eyes; specimens from Mat&iacute;as Romero, Oaxaca, had gold eyes heavily
flecked with gray; and individuals from Volc&aacute;n San Martin, Veracruz, had
bronze eyes.</p>

<p>The use of the trinomial here is arbitrary. Frogs of the
<i>Eleutherodactylus rugulosus</i> group in M&eacute;xico (<i>rugulosus</i>, <i>avocalis</i>,
and <i>vocalis</i>) exhibit only slight differences in size, proportions, and
coloration (Duellman, 1958c:6). Furthermore, the named populations are

<p>This species is indigenous to the pine-oak forests on the southern rim
of the Mexican Plateau, and has been collected at elevations from 1500
to 2500 meters. Males have been observed to call from rocks, rock
fences, clumps of grass, and low bushes; the call is a single "peep." At
San Juan de Parangaricutiro numerous specimens were found in the daytime
beneath adobe bricks and lava on the volcanic ash derived from Volc&aacute;n
Par&iacute;cutin; at Paracho individuals were found by day beneath rocks in a

and examination of ten others from the same locality (UMMZ 121571)
reveals that the relatively small size of the tympanum and absence of
dense ventral spotting place these specimens closer to <i>T. nitidus

<p>Until recently frogs of the genus <i>Diaglena</i> were known only from a few
specimens from southern Sinaloa (<i>Diaglena spatulata</i>) and from the
Pacific lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (<i>Diaglena reticulata</i>).
Peters (1955a) reported specimens from Ostula, Michoac&aacute;n, and compared
these specimens with one <i>D. reticulata</i> from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, and
four <i>D. spatulata</i> from Sinaloa. This comparison showed that the
specimens from Michoac&aacute;n, although showing some minor differences from
<i>D. reticulata</i>, are closer to that species than to <i>D. spatulata</i>.
Subsequent to Peters' work, series of both species of <i>Diaglena</i>,
including additional specimens from Michoac&aacute;n and from Colima, have been
collected, and a more qualified comparison is now possible.</p>

<p>In comparing specimens of <i>D. spatulata</i> from southern Sinaloa (UMMZ
115322) with specimens of <i>D. reticulata</i> from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (UMMZ
115321), the differences noted by Taylor (1942c:60) were found to be
constant. But specimens from Ostula, Michoac&aacute;n (UMMZ 104418), and five
individuals from Colima (TNHC 26379-83) were found to be intermediate in
certain characters. The skin of the dorsum in <i>D. reticulata</i> is
granular; that in <i>D. spatulata</i> is smooth. The skin in specimens from
Ostula and Colima is slightly granular. The dorsal ground color of <i>D.
reticulata</i> is yellowish brown with dark reticulations; the dorsal
ground color of <i>D. spatulata</i> is olive-green. Specimens from Ostula and
Colima most closely resemble those from Tehuantepec in coloration, but
the reticulations are more coarse, and the ground color has an
olive-green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> tint. <i>Diaglena reticulata</i> also differs from <i>D.
spatulata</i> in having a larger over-all size, slightly broader head, a
narrower interorbital distance, and a more pointed snout with a deeper
labial shelf (Table 4). The specimens from Ostula and Colima are
intermediate between <i>D. reticulata</i> from Oaxaca and <i>D. spatulata</i> from
Sinaloa in body proportions.</p>

<p>Of three specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley (JRD 5991-3), only two
are suitable for measuring. These specimens are smaller than adults from
the coastal areas and have broader heads and snouts, but narrower
interorbital distances, than specimens in the other samples (Table 4).
The texture of the skin is like that of specimens from Ostula and
Colima. The coloration resembles that of <i>D. reticulata</i>, but the
reticulations are bold and form indistinct bands on the hind limbs.</p>

<p>All specimens from Michoac&aacute;n and Colima more closely approach <i>Diaglena
reticulata</i> than <i>D. spatulata</i>. The acquisition of additional
specimens, especially from the area between Sinaloa and Colima and from
Guerrero, is necessary to determine the relationships among the various
populations known at present. Both species of <i>Diaglena</i> inhabit
tropical scrub forest; none has been found in the more humid and
tropical semi-deciduous forests. Humid forest replaces the scrub forest
in the lowlands of southern Nayarit and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> northern Jalisco; possibly this
forest acts as a barrier to the distribution of <i>Diaglena</i> and thus
serves as a divider between the ranges of <i>D. spatulata</i> to the north
and <i>D. reticulata</i> to the south.</p>

<p>This large tree frog has been found only in the lowlands below elevation
of about 1000 meters, usually in arid tropical scrub forest. Calling
males were heard on rainy nights throughout the rainy season; in nearly
every instance both males and females were found in low trees and
bushes. On summer nights when there had been no rain, adults were found
sitting on bushes in the scrub forest.</p>

<p>At Coalcom&aacute;n on July 1, 1955, a chorus was heard at midday. About forty
<i>Phyllomedusa dacnicolor</i> were found in one guayava bush at the edge of
a recently dried pond. Individual males were calling; clasping males
were silent. The call is a barking groan. Fifteen individual egg masses
were hanging from branches and leaves in tear-drop fashion. Each egg
mass contained 100 to 350 pale green eggs, located only in the exterior
part of the clear gelatinous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> mass. Two composite egg masses appeared to
have been made up by egg deposition on the part of three to five females
(Pl. 2, Fig. 2).</p>

<p>As shown by Duellman (1957a), the characters used by Taylor (1952) to
diagnose <i>Phyllomedusa alcorni</i> are sexually dimorphic. Funkhouser
(1957) apparently was unaware of this sexual dimorphism, for she
recognized <i>P. alcorni</i> and <i>P. dacnicolor</i> as distinct species.</p>

<p>One specimen of this large species was collected in 1951; it was found
on a low branch in tropical semi-deciduous forest at an elevation of 65
meters. In life there were olive-gray blotches on a pale gray dorsum;
the iris was a dark golden color.</p>

<p>This species, which is known from only a few specimens, seems to be
restricted to the coastal lowlands and low foothills from Guerrero
northward to Nayarit. Shannon and Humphrey (1957) described <i>Phrynohyas
corasterias</i> from Nayarit. Their description was based on a small female
having a snout-vent length of 34.4 mm. The new species was diagnosed as
differing from <i>P. inflata</i> in having less webbing on the feet, a poorly
developed supratympanic fold, a more pustulate dorsum, and marked
differences in dorsal pattern, color, and nature of antebrachial
banding. The significance of the webbing was questioned by Shannon and
Humphrey. The nature of the supratympanic fold and dorsal pustules
changes with age (Duellman, 1956a:31). <i>Phrynohyas inflata</i> is known to
attain a snout-vent length of 95 mm. Dermal structures that undergo
ontogenetic change are of little importance in comparing a juvenile with
a large adult. The only significant difference in color pattern between
<i>P. inflata</i> and <i>P. corasterias</i> is the presence of wide transverse
bands on the limbs of the latter. In this respect <i>P. corasterias</i>
approaches <i>P. latifasciata</i>, a species known only from two specimens
from southern Sinaloa. The acquisition of additional specimens from
Jalisco, Nayarit, and Sinaloa may show that <i>P. inflata</i> and <i>P.
latifasciata</i> are conspecific, as suggested by Duellman (1956a:21).
Nonetheless, the specimen on which the description of <i>P. corasterias</i>
was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> based is not sufficiently different from the known specimens of <i>P.
inflata</i> to warrant specific recognition.</p>

<p>Altitudinally this frog ranges from 500 to 2100 meters; although the
environments in which it has been found vary from open arid tropical
scrub forest to pine forest, it usually is found near rocky streams in
these habitats. There is great disparity in size between specimens from
the mountains and those from the Tepalcatepec Valley. Seven males from
elevations in excess of 1400 meters have an average snout-vent length of
34.7 mm.; nine from elevations below 1000 meters have an average
snout-vent length of 49.1 mm. In life a male collected at night at
Lombardia (UMMZ 112846) had dark brown spots on a grayish brown dorsum;
the groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, and ventral
surfaces of the hind limbs and palms were yellowish orange. The belly
and tips of digits were white; the vocal sac was purplish brown, and the
iris was dark grayish gold. In contrast, a specimen obtained in the
daytime at Chinapa (UMMZ 119204) had indistinct gray spots on a pale
ashy gray dorsum; the flash colors were yellow. After dark the spots
were dark olive-brown on a grayish brown dorsum.</p>

<p>Two males were found calling from a rocky stream near Lombardia on July
12, 1955. The call is a nasal "ah-ah-ah-ah."</p>

<p>This tree frog is widespread in the coastal lowlands and in the
Tepalcatepec Valley up to elevations of about 1200 meters. It is found
in numbers in the early part of the rainy season, at which time males
were heard calling from bushes and trees along ditches and temporary
ponds. The call is a loud nasal "waank-waank-waank." One individual that
was emitting a long and unusually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> high-pitched call was found to have
one hind limb engulfed by a <i>Leptodeira maculata</i>.</p>

mm.; tail length, 38.3 mm. Mouth ventral, its width equal to about
two-thirds of greatest width of body. Lips bordered by two rows of small
papillae; row of larger papillae between upper lip and outer upper
tooth-row, similar row between lower lip and outer lower tooth-row;
laterally these rows degenerating into numerous small papillae. Horny
beaks well developed; upper beak moderately arched and deeply indented;
lower beak slightly indented. Serrations of beaks blunt and peglike,
moderately developed on both beaks, but slightly stronger on lower one.
Tooth-rows 2/3; upper rows nearly equal in length and slightly longer

<p>More than 80 per cent of the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n have brown spots
between the lateral and dorsolateral dark stripes, and more than 50 per
cent have spots between the dorsolateral stripes, at least posteriorly.
In comparison with specimens from the Valley of M&eacute;xico, those from
Michoac&aacute;n have more distinct dorsolateral stripes that extend farther
anteriorly, sometimes to the eyelid, and in this respect are more nearly
like those from Jalisco and Nayarit (Taylor, 1939b:425). Some specimens
from the western part of Michoac&aacute;n possess certain characters used by
Maslin (1957:81) to distinguish <i>Hyla microeximia</i> from <i>H. eximia</i>;
nevertheless, the variation is such that two species cannot be
distinguished in Michoac&aacute;n. Four series of freshly preserved specimens
have been studied in detail; in the discussion below they are arranged
from west to east; the measurement is for snout-vent length of ten males
from each sample:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Zamora.</i>&mdash;Twenty-two specimens (UMMZ 102083), 24.0-27.6
(26.1) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe, or row of dashes,
present in all specimens; dark spots in lateral and dorsal
green fields; lateral dark stripe confluent with
dorsolateral stripe posteriorly in 18 specimens; white line
not extending to groin.</p>

<p><i>Temazcal.</i>&mdash;Thirty-five specimens (UMMZ 119162), 26.5-31.1
(28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe of row of spots present
only posteriorly in most; both dorsolateral stripes and
dorsal spots lacking in four specimens; heavy spotting
dorsally in three others; lateral and dorsolateral dark
stripes confluent posteriorly in three; lateral white stripe
extending to groin in 16 specimens.</p>

<p><i>Ciudad Hidalgo.</i>&mdash;Thirty-six specimens (UMMZ 119163),
26.4-30.9 (28.2) mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of
spots present only posteriorly in most; no brown spots in
the green fields of many specimens; large brown inguinal
spot in most specimens; heavy spotting dorsally in four;
lateral and dorsolateral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> dark stripes confluent posteriorly
in five; lateral white line extending to groin in most
specimens.</p>

<p><i>Tuxpan.</i>&mdash;Fifteen specimens (UMMZ 115227), 28.7-33.0 (30.5)
mm. Dorsolateral dark stripe or row of dashes in all
specimens; dark spots in lateral green fields, at least
posteriorly in most; dark spots posteriorly in the dorsal
green field in five; lateral dark stripe separated from
dorsolateral stripe in all specimens; lateral white line
extends to the groin in all specimens.</p></div>

<p>As can be seen from the above descriptions, the distinguishing
characters of <i>Hyla microeximia</i>&mdash;confluence of lateral and dorsolateral
dark stripes posteriorly, extent of lateral white stripe, and
distribution of dark spots dorsally&mdash;are found in individuals from all
of the populations sampled. In the samples from western Michoac&aacute;n there
is a higher incidence of <i>microeximia</i>-like frogs than in those from
other parts of the state. <i>Hyla eximia</i> is a wide-ranging species
varying greatly geographically and individually. A thorough review of
the species and related members of the <i>Hyla eximia</i>-group is necessary
before certain populations can justifiably be segregated as subspecies
or species.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Hyla eximia</i> has been collected in mesquite-grassland,
pine-oak forest, and cultivated areas on the Mexican Plateau from 1500
to 2300 meters; apparently it is absent from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n.
This is the most abundant frog on the southern part of the Mexican
Plateau; in the rainy season breeding choruses are found in temporary
pools and in the marshes adjacent to the permanent lakes.</p>

<p>Cerro San Andr&eacute;s (26); Opopeo (9).</p></div>

<p>In March, 1949, James A. Peters collected this species at elevations of
2400 to 2800 meters on the west slope of Cerro San Andr&eacute;s. The frogs
were found beneath logs and rocks in a damp canyon in coniferous forest.
Among the juveniles in this series is a completely transformed
individual (UMMZ 102093) having a snout-vent length of 14.5 mm. Five
adults have snout-vent lengths of 36.2-39.5 (38.0) mm. <i>Hyla lafrentzi</i>
has noticeably longer hind limbs than <i>H. eximia</i>; in the former, when
the hind limb is brought forward along the body, the tibiotarsal
articulation extends to the snout. There are dark transverse bands on
the hind limbs; the dorsolateral stripe is broken into an anterior and a
posterior segment, and the latter is narrowly bordered by white in most
specimens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hyla lafrentzi</i> occurs at higher elevations than any other frog in
Michoac&aacute;n; the locality records from throughout the range indicate that
it is restricted to pine and pine-fir forests. In these habitats it
replaces <i>Hyla eximia</i>, which inhabits the lower pine-oak forests and
mesquite-grassland on the Mexican Plateau. Ponds are absent at places
where <i>Hyla lafrentzi</i> has been collected; possibly the eggs are laid in
streams.</p>

<p>Taylor (1940a:18) diagnosed this species as having few or no vomerine
teeth, no vocal sac, a rather broad and flat head, two large tubercles
below the anus, a granular venter, and a green dorsum in life. The
specimens on which the description was based are either immature or
non-breeding individuals; all were collected from bromeliads growing on
cacti near Cojumatl&aacute;n. Another small, flat-headed hylid from Tepoztl&aacute;n,
Morelos, was described and diagnosed by Taylor (1943b:49) as differing
from <i>Hyla smaragdina</i> in having a vocal sac and a broader head. This
specimen was named <i>Hylella azteca</i>. Specimens from the coastal region

Michoac&aacute;n has resulted in the conclusion that all pertain to only one
species. Although the type series of <i>Hyla smaragdina</i> consists of
immature specimens, the males in that series do possess vocal sacs.
Since these were not breeding individuals, the sacs are not well
developed. The characters of the anal tubercles and the relative width
of the head are of no value in separating the two species. The
apparently aestivating individuals comprising the type series of <i>Hyla
smaragdina</i>, and the type of <i>Hylella azteca</i>, which also was found in a
bromeliad, were green in life. Of the calling males found on the coast
of Michoac&aacute;n, most were yellowish tan when found; two were pale green,
but soon changed to pale tan. Calling males from Copuyo and Dos Aguas
were pale yellowish tan. Therefore the color of the dorsum is of little
significance in distinguishing the two named populations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Males of <i>Hyla smaragdina</i> have been found calling in the months of June
and July from rocky streams; the call is a nasal "haah-haah-haah,"
repeated quickly and constantly for as long as 30 seconds. As pointed
out by Duellman (1958c:9), this breeding behavior is unlike that
suggested by Taylor (1943b:51). In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Hyla smaragdina</i> has been
found in tropical semi-deciduous forest, oak forest, and
mesquite-grassland at elevations from 150 to 1500 meters.</p>

<p>This small hylid is abundant in the Tepalcatepec Valley to elevations of
about 1000 meters; it was found infrequently on the coastal lowlands.
Males call from bushes in and around flooded fields and ditches, from
grasses and small herbs in the water and from vegetation overhanging
small streams. The call consists of a series of short, high notes,
somewhat reminiscent of a katydid's song. In the dry season occasional
males were heard calling from irrigated fields near Apatzing&aacute;n. In the
daytime individuals were found in the axils of leaves of the
elephant-ear plants (<i>Xanthosoma</i>).</p>

<p>In living individuals the dorsal color usually is uniform pale yellow;
often the lateral white stripe is barely visible. The vocal sac is
bright yellow, and the iris is pale gold. In some individuals there are
scattered dark brown spots or flecks on the back and upper surfaces of
limbs. Twenty males from Apatzing&aacute;n have the following measurements:
snout-vent length, 22.8-26.0 (25.0) mm., tibia length, 10.7-13.6 (12.6)
mm.; head width, 7.2-8.0 (7.6) mm., head length, 7.1-8.1 (7.7) mm.</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>Hypopachus</i> from the Balsas drainage in Michoac&aacute;n have
characters consistent with topotypic <i>H. caprimimus</i>. Eleven specimens
from the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau all have the flanks darker
than the dorsum, a distinct and continuous dark stripe from the occiput
to the groin, a large dark spot in the inguinal region, and a pair of
dark transverse stripes on the thigh and shank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> (Pl. 6, Fig. 1). With
the exception of three specimens from Charapendo, all have a
predominantly brown venter with round, cream-colored spots.</p>

<p>Peters (1954:8) referred specimens from Buena Vista and San Salvador to
<i>Hypopachus oxyrrhinus</i>. He stated that the specimen (BMNH
1914.1.28.150) from San Salvador had flanks much darker than the dorsum
and a well-defined continuous stripe from the occiput to the groin; this
specimen has the characters of <i>H. caprimimus</i>. The specimen (BMNH
1914.1.28.151) from Buena Vista resembles <i>H. oxyrrhinus</i> in some
characters, but it is not like <i>H. oxyrrhinus ovis</i> on the Mexican
Plateau in Michoac&aacute;n. The specimen has paired transverse stripes on the
hind limbs as does <i>H. caprimimus</i>, and is here referred to that
species.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species has been collected in arid tropical scrub
forest at elevations of 200 to 1800 meters in the northern foothills of
the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, the Tepalcatepec and Tuxpan valleys, and on the
lower slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. Calling males have been found
along streams. One specimen from Charapendo was regurgitated by a
<i>Leptodeira maculata</i>.</p>

<p>Thirty-seven specimens from the Mexican Plateau in northwestern
Michoac&aacute;n agree well with the diagnosis of <i>Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis</i>
by Shannon and Humphrey (1958). With the exception of one specimen from
Tangamandapio, all have dark bellies extensively mottled or spotted with
cream-color. Most of the specimens have some form of an irregular,
usually broken, dark line from the occiput to the groin. In eight
specimens there is no line or linear arrangement of spots; instead the
dorsum is spotted or flecked with dark brown. The ground color of the
dorsum and flanks varies from dull reddish brown to grayish brown;
cream-colored spots are evident on the flanks and posterior surfaces of
the thighs in all specimens (Pl. 6, Fig. 2).</p>

<p>In comparison with 14 specimens from Queser&iacute;a, Colima (UMMZ 80001-2),
individuals from the Mexican Plateau have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> darker venter with bolder
markings, and a more mottled dorsum.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species has been taken between 1500 and 2200 meters on
the Mexican Plateau, where it inhabits mesquite-grassland and cultivated
areas.</p>

at the limnological station at P&aacute;tzcuaro by Paul S. Martin in 1948, and
eight specimens found in shaded ditches along the R&iacute;o de Morelia by
Robert R. Miller on April 4, 1957. The R&iacute;o de Morelia flows into Lago de
Cuitzeo; this drainage is separated from Lago de P&aacute;tzcuaro by a chain of
hills about 2400 meters in elevation. Dr. Richard G. Zweifel has
examined these specimens and has informed me that, although they differ
slightly from typical <i>Rana dunni</i>, they are much closer to that species
than to <i>Rana montezumae</i>.</p>

altitudinal range of any amphibian in Michoac&aacute;n. It has been found
frequently in the Tepalcatepec Valley; it is not a distinctly highland
species in southern Michoac&aacute;n, as stated by Peters (1954:9). One

<p>Green sea turtles are abundant along the coast of Michoac&aacute;n. Laying
females and fresh nests were found on August 6-12, 1950, July 14-16,
1951, and July 8-10, 1955. The general account of sea turtles on the
coast of Michoac&aacute;n that was given by Peters (1957) is supplemented here
by my field notes on the actions of one female observed on the night of
July 14, 1951, near Maruata by Donald D. Brand and I. Because of a full
moon, visibility was excellent.</p>

<p>In the course of the day several <i>Chelonia</i> were seen in the surf;
shortly after dark the first turtle was observed on the beach. Several
were observed to come out on the beach and crawl nearly to the strand
line, only to return to the sea.</p>

<p>At 10:20 p. m. one turtle was seen about 15 meters from the water. We
watched this turtle from some distance and observed that by 10:26 p. m.
she had moved about ten meters to a bank of sand about two meters high.
Ten minutes later she had climbed the bank and disappeared over the top
into the brush. We moved closer and remained hidden below the bank.
Although we could not see the turtle, we could hear her movements.
Between 10:37 and 10:57 p. m. the turtle dug, often flipping the dry
sand for a distance of about two meters. When this energetic digging
ceased, we moved up the bank to see that she was facing inland and
sitting in a depression about one and one-half meters in diameter and 30
centimeters in depth. She had cleaned out this depression in the past 20
minutes. Between 11:00 and 11:36 p. m. she dug the nest hole by first
scooping sand with one hind flipper and then with the other; when sand
was thrown by one flipper, there was a similar, but weaker, motion by
the other flipper. At 11:36 p. m. she stopped digging. By crawling up
behind the turtle we were able to examine the nest cavity, which
measured 21 centimeters across the top and 38 centimeters deep. The
diameter of the bottom of the hole was estimated to be about 50
centimeters. At 11:40 p. m. she released the first egg; a minute later
she dropped the second. At 11:42 p. m. the third and fourth eggs were
released; these were coherent, as were the fifth and sixth eggs released
at 11:43 p. m. After this, as many as three eggs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> were dropped at a
time. After laying about 60 eggs, she paused for a minute and then
continued laying. By 11:55 p. m. she had laid 98 eggs; after this, the
process of deposition slowed considerably. She dropped a fragment of an
egg followed by normal eggs. At midnight she deposited a miniature egg
about 20 mm. in diameter. This terminated the deposition. Immediately
she began to cover the nest.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes after the last egg was deposited the nest had been
covered. The turtle first had been seen at 10:20 p. m.; judging from its
speed and its distance from the water, the turtle probably had been on
land for about ten minutes. About 25 minutes were used in crawling from
the water to the nesting site. One hour and 33 minutes were spent at the
nesting site; of this time twenty minutes were taken for egg deposition.
The turtle was not followed back to the water, but if the return trip
took approximately the same amount of time as required to travel from
the ocean to the nesting site, the total elapsed time from departure to
return to the water was about two and one-half hours.</p>

<p>We collected the eggs as they were deposited. There were 106 eggs, each
having a diameter of about 40 mm., plus one small egg and a fragment of
another. The turtle had a carapace about one meter in length.</p>

<p>From our limited observations of sea turtles and their tracks on the
beaches, and from the accounts of these animals by the residents of the
coastal region, great numbers of sea turtles use these relatively
uninhabited beaches for nesting grounds. However, the turtles do not go
unmolested. The natives capture turtles and collect their eggs. Opened
and emptied nests also showed signs of predatory activity on the part of
other mammals. In the vicinity of Playa Azul several turtles were killed
by dogs.</p>

<p>A juvenile from 21 kilometers south of Arteaga (UMMZ 118933) had
alternating black and white bands on the tail. In life most of the
lizards are dull ashy gray or grayish tan above and white below.
According to Dixon (<i>in litt.</i>), one specimen from Apatzing&aacute;n (UMMZ
115102) resembles <i>Phyllodactylus magnus</i> in scutellation, but it lacks
the distinctive yellow venter of that species.</p>

<p>Apparently <i>Phyllodactylus lanei</i> is restricted to rather mesic
environments in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Valley and surrounding
foothills; in the more open arid environments on the floor of the valley
it seems to be replaced by <i>Phyllodactylus duellmani</i>.</p>

<p>Three females from Arteaga (UMMZ 119075) have snout-vent lengths of 41,
41, and 44 mm. In life the pale grayish brown dorsum was marked with
dark brown; the belly was white, and the throat was pale pink. All have
a dark interorbital bar and dark vertical bars on the upper labials. In
two specimens there are only scattered dark flecks on the dorsum; in the
third there is a dark postorbital stripe, a dark lateral stripe, and
four narrow transverse bands on the body. A male from 19 kilometers
south of Arteaga (UMMZ 119076) having a snout-vent length of 49 mm. had
in life a tan dorsum, a broad white stripe from the ear to the groin,
scattered small white spots on the dorsum, and indistinct pale
cream-colored spots on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. This male
has the dark labial bars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> but lacks the dark interorbital bar, found in
the females. The large rose-pink throat fan extends to about the middle
of the belly. In all of the specimens the middorsal scales are keeled
and much smaller than the smooth pavementlike or slightly imbricate
ventrals. All have two gulars in contact with the mental, five scales
between the nasals, five scales (not including the first labials) in
contact with the rostral, and four rows of loreals. In these characters
these specimens agree well with <i>Anolis dunni</i> from Guerrero, as
diagnosed by Davis (1954b).</p>

<p>Previously <i>Anolis dunni</i> has been reported only from the vicinity of
Agua del Obispo, Guerrero, a locality situated at an elevation of about
900 meters in pine-oak forest in the Sierra del Sur. All known close
relatives of <i>Anolis dunni</i> occur only in Guerrero: <i>A. taylori</i> Smith
and Spieler from Acapulco, <i>A. gadowi</i> Boulenger from Tierra Colorado,
<i>A. liogaster</i> Boulenger, and <i>A. omiltemanus</i> Davis from Omiltemi. The
present specimens from elevations of about 900 meters in riparian stream
vegetation and oak forest represent the northern known limits of this

<p>Even with the abundance of material the assignment of a specific name to
these anoles is only tentative, for definite determination between
<i>Anolis nebulosus</i> Wiegmann and <i>A. nebuloides</i> Bocourt is uncertain.
Bocourt (1873:75) distinguished <i>A. nebuloides</i> from <i>A. nebulosus</i> by
the following characters: (1) head scales keeled, not smooth; (2) snout
narrower; (3) ear opening larger; (4) supraorbital semicircles separated
by a row of small scales and not in contact; (5) dorsal scales larger
and subequal in size to the belly scales. Boulenger (1885:77) used the
same characters; Smith and Taylor (1950b:58) in their key to the Mexican
species<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> of <i>Anolis</i> stated that the dorsal scales are slightly smaller
than the ventrals in <i>A. nebulosus</i> and markedly smaller in <i>A.
nebuloides</i>. Smith (<i>in litt.</i>) stated that the characters of the
relative sizes of the dorsal and ventral scales were incorrect in that
key.</p>

<p>The application of the above criteria to specimens from Michoac&aacute;n has
not resulted in the recognition of two species. The majority of the
specimens have the supraorbital semicircles separated by at least one
small scale; the head scales, with the exception of those on the snout
in a few individuals, are smooth; the dorsal scales are only slightly
smaller than the ventrals. In other characters of scutellation the
specimens are highly variable. The males in life have an orange throat
fan. Anoles of this kind have been found in Michoac&aacute;n, Colima, Jalisco,
Nayarit, and southern Sinaloa. Near Oaxaca, Oaxaca, specimens were
collected that superficially resemble those from Michoac&aacute;n and farther
north. These have low keels on the snout scales, dorsals somewhat larger
than the ventrals, and a pink throat fan. In ten males from Oaxaca the
size of the dorsal scales relative to that of the ventrals is 1.00:0.83;
the same ratio for 25 males from Michoac&aacute;n is 1.00:1.08. In both samples
there are specimens in which the dorsal and ventral scales are about
equal in size.</p>

<p>Investigations by Richard E. Etheridge on the osteology of <i>Anolis</i>,
including those species here being considered, have revealed relatively
constant differences in the parasternalia and in the caudal vertebrae.
The application of Etheridge's findings to anoline systematics must
await the completion of his study.</p>

<p>The carination of the scales on the snout <i>versus</i> smooth scales there
seems to be the only significant character given by Bocourt that
distinguishes <i>A. Nebuloides</i> from <i>A. nebulosus</i>. The difference in the
color of the throat fan, which is apparent only in living individuals,
is more striking. Obviously more than one species is represented, as is
borne out by the differences in the color of the throat fan and in the
osteology, but there is uncertainty about the correct name for each
species. On the strength of Bocourt's diagnosis of keeled snout scales
in <i>A. nebuloides</i>, I am applying that name to the population in Oaxaca
and <i>A. nebulosus</i> to the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n. As arranged here,
the two species can be distinguished, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A. nebulosus.</i>&mdash;Dorsal scales only slightly smaller than
the ventral scales; snout scales usually smooth; throat-fan
bright orange in adult males.</p>

<p><i>A. nebuloides.</i>&mdash;Dorsal scales somewhat larger than the
ventral scales; snout scales having a low keel; throat-fan
pink in adult males.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to geographic distribution, <i>A. nebulosus</i> has been
collected from southern Sinaloa southward to Michoac&aacute;n. The lizards here
referred to <i>A. nebuloides</i> have been taken only in pine-oak forest on
the mountain slopes near Oaxaca City. Zweifel and Norris (1955:233)
reported anoles with pink throat-fans from southern Sonora; possibly
those specimens are <i>A. nebuloides</i>; I have not examined them. I have
seen several preserved specimens from the vicinity of Tehuantepec,
Oaxaca. Although they probably belong to this group, those specimens
differ from both <i>A. nebulosus</i> and <i>A. nebuloides</i> in their larger
size, relatively larger head, and much larger throat fan.</p>

<p>Aside from the minor variation in scutellation, specimens of <i>Anolis
nebulosus</i> from Michoac&aacute;n vary greatly in coloration. Usually the
females have some form of a broad middorsal pale-colored band. In life
this is dull yellow, tan, or orange. Two females from Dos Aguas are
strikingly different; one (UMMZ 119521) has a broad middorsal orange
stripe that is scalloped laterally and bordered by gray. The other (UMMZ
119081) has a narrow middorsal cream-colored line. Males usually are
unicolor brown or olive-tan; sometimes the middorsal region is darker.
Some individuals have dark cross-bands or chevrons on the dorsum. One
male from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 119080) has a cream-colored lateral stripe.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Anolis nebulosus</i> occurs from sea level to elevations
slightly in excess of 2100 meters, usually in areas of dense cover,
whether this be herbaceous, viney, or woody, ordinarily on the ground as
well as in bushes and trees. One was in a bromeliad growing about ten
meters above the ground. In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley anoles of this
species are most frequently found in the tangled growth along streams.
Above Uruapan they were found in pine-oak forest, and on the Mexican
Plateau between Zamora and Zacapu they were found in a bunch grass-scrub
oak association.</p>

<p>Peters (1954:11) reported on the specimen from La Placita; another was

having a snout-vent length of 43.0 mm. and a tail length of 70.5 mm. The
dorsal ground color is pale tan; there are five pairs of irregular dark

1955, scores of individuals were seen around Estero Pichi at Playa Azul.
Adults, especially the large males, are exceedingly wary and difficult

<p><i>Ctenosaura pectinata</i> is a common lowland species that ascends the
slopes of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica to
elevations of about 1050 meters (approximating the lower limits of the
oak forest). The record from Uruapan (USNM 10234, collected by Dug&egrave;s) is
doubtful.</p>

<p>These large lizards are most easily observed on rock fences along roads.
Near Apatzing&aacute;n innumerable individuals can be seen in mid-morning.
Later in the day, as the sun rises higher in the sky, the lizards
retreat to the shade of the crevices in the fences. The abundance of
these lizards in the Tepalcatepec Valley, together with evidence
gathered from the natives of the valley, indicates that these lizards
are seldom used for human consumption there. On the other hand, several
people in Coalcom&aacute;n consider the "iguana negra" (local name for
<i>Ctenosaura</i>) to be a delicacy and serve it at every opportunity. In
early July, 1951, brilliant green young of the year were collected at La
Playa and at Coalcom&aacute;n.</p>

<i>Apoplanesia paniculata</i>, and <i>Cercidium plurifoliolatum</i>. Continued
collecting in the Tepalcatepec Valley has borne out the suggestions of

of this lizard. Also, continued collecting in Colima and on the Pacific

lowlands of Michoac&aacute;n and Guerrero. The distribution of this species,
therefore, is discontinuous. One population<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> inhabits the lowlands of

rather open coniferous forests in which there is a more or less
continuous cover of grasses on the ground. On warm sunny days the
lizards can be observed scurrying about in the grass; in the early hours
of the day, or on cold days, they are found beneath stones, logs, or

<p>Heretofore this species has been known only from a few specimens from
scattered localities in the Sierra Madre Occidental in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> southwestern
Jalisco and Sinaloa. The collection of a large series of these lizards
in virgin pine forest at elevations of more than 2000 meters in the
Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n now makes possible an analysis of variation in the
species.</p>

<p>Superficially <i>S. bulleri</i> resembles <i>S. torquatus</i>, but <i>S. bulleri</i> is
smaller, has more dorsal scales, fewer scales in the dark collar, and
fewer femoral pores. In 88 specimens of <i>S. bulleri</i> there are 36-41
(38.7) dorsal scales and 2 or 3 (2.6) middorsal scales in the collar, as
compared with 28-31 (29.3) dorsal scales and 3 or 4 (3.4) middorsal
scales in the collar of 26 specimens of <i>S. torquatus</i> from Uruapan. In
20 adult males of <i>S. bulleri</i> there are 13-15 (14.3) femoral pores, and
13-16 (14.4) in 11 females; 13 males of <i>S. torquatus</i> have 14-21 (17.3)
femoral pores, and 13 females have 15-21 (16.7). Seventeen adult males
of <i>S. bulleri</i> have snout-vent lengths of 72-91 (82.0); ten females,
71-87 (75.7). In comparison, 13 adult males of <i>S. torquatus</i> have an
average snout-vent length of 88.9 mm., and 13 females, 88.5 mm. In <i>S.
bulleri</i> there is little variation in the head scales. The frontal is in
contact with the interparietal in 63, and not in 24, specimens; the
median frontonasal is in contact with the frontal in 13, and not in 74,
specimens. In 39 specimens there are two canthals, and in 48 there is
one; in 29 specimens there are three preauriculars, and in 58 there are
four.</p>

<p>In life adult males have a pale blue tail, bright blue belly patches, a
purplish blue throat, and pale blue lines on the sides of the head and
neck.</p>

<p>This species was obtained at four localities in the high mountains of
the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. In this mountain range <i>Sceloporus bulleri</i>
apparently replaces <i>S. torquatus</i>, a species that is widespread in the
Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica and on the Mexican Plateau. At Dos Aguas and at
Acuaro de las Lleguas the lizards were abundant in the tall pine forest,
where they were found on standing pine trees, on pine logs, and on rock
outcroppings.</p>

Tangamandapio and Tanganc&iacute;cuaro have 44-48 (45.7) dorsal scales, as
compared with an average of 38.7 in <i>S. bulleri</i> and 29.3 in <i>S.
torquatus</i>. In life <i>Sceloporus dugesi intermedius</i> has a dull greenish
gray dorsum; in males the belly patches are bright blue bordered
medially by black, and the throat is bluish gray. The largest specimen
examined is a male having a snout-vent length of 80 mm.</p>

<p>Although this species has a rather extensive range in the
Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin in the state of Michoac&aacute;n, Guerrero, Morelos,
and Puebla, it is only locally abundant in that area. Usually these
lizards are found on rocky cliffs in which there are many crevices for
cover. <i>Sceloporus gadowae</i> is abundant on a conglomerate cliff along
the R&iacute;o Marquez south of Lombardia. Although the closely related <i>S.
pyrocephalus</i> is abundant in the stream valley and in the hills above
the cliff, <i>S. gadowae</i> has been found only on the cliff; few
individuals of <i>S. pyrocephalus</i> have been observed on the cliff. A
similar situation was discovered on a much more extensive conglomerate
cliff along the R&iacute;o Balsas near Mexcala, Guerrero. Near Tehuitzingo,
Puebla, where <i>S. pyrocephalus</i> was not found, <i>S. gadowae</i> was found on
conglomerate cliffs. Probably there is strong competition between the
two species; possibly this has resulted in the restriction of <i>S.
gadowae</i> to isolated cliff-habitats within the extensive range of the
more widespread <i>S. pyrocephalus</i>.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Sceloporus gadowae</i> has been found along the lower slopes
of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica at elevations from 250 to 1050 meters. All
of the localities from which this lizard is known lie in the arid
tropical scrub forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>This small species of <i>Sceloporus</i> is an ubiquitous inhabitant of the
coniferous forests from 1550 to 3100 meters in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica.
Usually it is seen on tree trunks, but occasionally on the ground. Near
the lower limit of the altitudinal distribution of the species, as at
Uruapan, individuals sometimes are found on broad-leafed trees.
Apparently <i>Sceloporus heterolepis</i> replaces <i>S. grammicus

<p>Although Michoac&aacute;n has not previously been included in the range of this
lizard, it was first collected in the state by Gadow in 1908 (BMNH
1914.1.28.69 from Araparicuaro). The description of <i>S. heterolepis</i>
given by Smith (1939:197) can be supplemented by data on the 23
specimens now in the collections of the Museum of Zoology at the
University of Michigan. All have two canthals; there are 55 to 71 (63.6)
scales in the middorsal row; 1 to 3 rows middorsally are somewhat
enlarged and bordered on either side by a row of larger scales bearing
high keels. There are 14 to 20 (16.2) femoral pores. Eight adult males
have snout-vent lengths from 49 to 61 (58.0) mm. and tail lengths from
57 to 74 (66.0) mm.; four adult females have snout-vent lengths from 52
to 57 (55.2) mm. and tail lengths from 60 to 66 (63.5) mm. The smallest
of eight juveniles has a snout-vent length of 28 mm. and a tail length
of 32 mm. The dorsum in adults is pale grayish brown; there are three
irregular chevron-shaped dark marks and a triangular dark brown mark
above the insertion of the hind limbs; on the tail are dark brown rings.
There are scattered faint blue flecks on the flanks and narrow
transverse dark lines on the lower limbs. Males<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> have pale bluish green
belly patches and an orange-salmon-colored throat; the belly in females
is pale orange-tan. The juveniles have a more contrasting color pattern;
the dark chevrons on the dorsum are bordered posteriorly by pale gray.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species has been obtained in pine and pine-fir forests
from 1800 to 2700 meters. On Cerro Barolosa and at Dos Aguas, both in
the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, the lizards were found beneath the bark of
dead, standing pines. In the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n <i>Sceloporus
heterolepis</i> seems to fill the niche of the small arboreal <i>Sceloporus</i>
in the coniferous forest in southwestern M&eacute;xico, a position held by <i>S.
grammicus microlepidotus</i> in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica; the latter
species does not occur in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. Five specimens of
<i>Sceloporus heterolepis</i> are known from the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica,
whereas 603 of <i>S. grammicus microlepidotus</i> have been collected there.
The ecological relationships that exist between the two species in the
Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica are not known.</p>

<p>Insofar as is known, <i>Sceloporus heterolepis</i> reaches the southern
limits of its range in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and in the western part
of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. Other records for the species are from the
Sierra Madre Occidental in Jalisco. Langebartel (1959) described
<i>Sceloporus shannonorum</i> from the mountains near the Durango-Sinaloa
border; the single specimen of <i>S. shannonorum</i> differs significantly
from <i>S. heterolepis</i> only in having fewer dorsal scales (48). The
acquisition of additional material, especially from Nayarit and northern
Jalisco, probably will provide a basis for showing that these two
populations are conspecific.</p>

<p>Smith (1942a:360) diagnosed <i>Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster</i> as
having fewer femoral pores than the other subspecies of <i>S.
melanorhinus</i> and as having the lateral belly patches in the males
confluent in the midline. Examination of forty specimens from the
Tepalcatepec Valley and the coastal regions of Michoac&aacute;n does not
substantiate this diagnosis. The number of femoral pores varies from 15
to 22 (18.9); 14 individuals (35%) had 20 or more femoral pores. Smith
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) stated that <i>S. melanorhinus</i> in Oaxaca had 18 to 27
(21.6) femoral pores and that 77 per cent of the specimens had more than
20 femoral pores. Of the 24 males examined from Michoac&aacute;n, 18 have the
lateral belly patches separated in the midline. Usually they are
separated by no more than one scale, but in some individuals they are
separated by two or more scales. Although the above data minimize
certain differences between the northern and southern populations of
this species, certain of the color pattern characters seem to be
diagnostic of the subspecies inhabiting the Pacific lowlands from
Guerrero to Nayarit. Large adults of <i>S. m. calligaster</i> have only a
faint dorsal pattern, which in the subspecies <i>melanorhinus</i> and
<i>stuarti</i> consists of a series of large, dark, interconnected triangles
on the back. This pattern is present in young and small adults of <i>S. m.
calligaster</i>; furthermore, in this subspecies the ventral coloration of
the males differs from that found in the more southern populations.
Adult males of <i>S. m. calligaster</i> have a black throat, that changes to
brilliant blue posteriorly, and a large white spot medially on the chin.
This spot is present in some specimens from Oaxaca and Chiapas, but, if
present, it is much smaller and less distinct than in specimens from
Michoac&aacute;n. In <i>S. m. calligaster</i> the chest and midventral area are
orange to salmon-color.</p>

<p>A male from Lombardia in life was colored as follows: Dorsum grayish tan
bearing faint bluish gray flecks; chest deep salmon-orange,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> this color
continuing down midventral area to the somewhat paler groin; belly
patches pale blue fading to pale green laterally; throat black
anteriorly enclosing a white spot; throat blue posteriorly and bluish
green posterolaterally.</p>

<p>Individual lizards were observed to change in dorsal color from a pale
ashy gray to a rather dull brown. Normally, inactive individuals and
those observed on overcast days were dull brown.</p>

<p><i>Sceloporus melanorhinus calligaster</i> is found in trees in riparian
situations in the lowlands to elevations of about 1500 meters. It does
not inhabit the arid tropical scrub forest in the Tepalcatepec Valley or
on the coast, but in those areas is found in the gallery forests along
streams and rivers. The lizards are wary and live high in the trees;
they are especially difficult to locate in the rainy season, when the
trees are in full leaf.</p>

<p>This small species is extremely common in the Tepalcatepec Valley and
noticeably less so on the coast. It is usually found on the ground in
rocky areas, but males frequently have been seen on the trunks of low
trees in the scrub forest. Altitudinally, it ranges from sea level to
slightly more than 1000 meters. The sexes are readily distinguished in
the field (Oliver, 1937; Smith, 1939; Duellman, 1954b). In the dry
season only males were observed in the Tepalcatepec Valley, but in the
rainy season both sexes were found in approximately the same numbers.</p>

usually is found in pine or pine-fir forests at elevations between 1450

<p>The known distribution and geographic variation of <i>Urosaurus
bicarinatus</i> in southwestern M&eacute;xico presents a confused picture. In
general rugosity, specimens from the coastal region of Michoac&aacute;n
(Coahuayana, La Orilla, La Placita, Playa Azul, and P&oacute;maro) resemble <i>U.
bicarinatus tuberculatus</i> to the north along the Pacific coast.
Furthermore, specimens from the coast have less stippling in the gular
region than do those from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and the slopes of the
Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. Specimens from the mountains have greatly carinate
enlarged dorsals, large lateral tubercles, and heavily stippled throats;
in these characters they resemble specimens from Morelos, Guerrero, and
Oaxaca. As mentioned by Peters (1954:14), some specimens from La Orilla
and San Salvador are like <i>U. bicarinatus bicarinatus</i> in certain
characters, and one specimen has the blue ventral patches restricted to
the sternal area, a characteristic of <i>U. bicarinatus anonymorphus</i> of
Oaxaca and eastern Guerrero. Examination of all available specimens from
Michoac&aacute;n indicates that the nature of the dorsal scales is of little
value in separating the subspecies. The specimens from Michoac&aacute;n are
here provisionally referred to <i>U. bicarinatus tuberculatus</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> because
cursory examination of specimens from several localities between Nayarit
and Oaxaca shows that there are only minor differences between the named
populations. Individuals from the northern part of the range are more
rugose and have larger blue ventral patches and less gular stippling
than those from the south.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus</i> is found in wooded
areas, not in open scrub forest, in the coastal area to elevations of
about 900 meters, and along the slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica and
the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau at elevations from 1000 to 1700
meters. The record for Tup&aacute;taro probably is erroneous, for no other
specimens of this species are known from the central plateau.
Essentially, the distribution of this species parallels that of
<i>Sceloporus utiformis</i>, a strictly terrestrial species. <i>Urosaurus
bicarinatus tuberculatus</i> lives on tree trunks. Below 1000 meters in the
Tepalcatepec Valley <i>Urosaurus bicarinatus tuberculatus</i> is replaced by
<i>Urosaurus gadowi</i>.</p>

<p>Although individuals of this species have been collected at elevations
slightly exceeding 1200 meters on Volc&aacute;n Jorullo and at 1100 meters at
Ziracuaretiro on the southern slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, for
the most part these lizards are found at elevations of less than 800
meters, where they inhabit the open arid scrub forest of the
Tepalcatepec Valley, a region to which this species is endemic
(Duellman, 1958b:49). These small lizards usually are found on the
trunks and main branches of the small trees in the scrub forest; in this
habitat they are associated with <i>Sceloporus horridus oligoporus</i>, a
much larger species.</p>

<p>Males have a pale orange spot on the throat and a pale blue belly;
females have immaculate venters.</p>

<p>A specimen from Guayabo on the northern slopes of the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n was referred to <i>Urosaurus irregularis</i> (Fischer) by Peters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
(1954:15). I have studied this specimen (BMNH 1914.1.28.110), a female
having a snout-vent length of 46 mm., and agree with Peters that it
closely resembles Fischer's description and figure (1882: pl. 17, fig.
1). This specimen and those seen of <i>Urosaurus gadowi</i> all have
pavementlike enlarged dorsal scales that are complete across the
vertical line. In <i>U. gadowi</i> the enlarged dorsals usually are in four
to six irregular rows; in the specimen from Guayabo the dorsals are in
two rows. Although none of the other specimens of <i>U. gadowi</i> examined
has only two rows of enlarged dorsals, I prefer to consider the specimen
from Guayabo as an aberrant individual of that species, rather than <i>U.
irregularis</i>. Guayabo is in the known range of <i>U. gadowi</i>. <i>Urosaurus
irregularis</i> is known only from the type specimen in the Bremen Museum;
the type locality, according to Fischer (1882:232), is "Aus dem
Hochlande von Mexico." If an examination of the type specimen of <i>U.
irregularis</i> shows it to be identical with <i>U. gadowi</i>, then <i>U.
irregularis</i> would be the name for the lizards here referred to <i>U.

<p>One specimen of this rare species was found beneath a rock in the open
scrub forest 12 kilometers east of Apatzing&aacute;n on July 3, 1955. Another
skink, presumably of this species, was seen at Capirio. The specimen
from east of Apatzing&aacute;n is a male having a snout-vent length of 97 mm.
and an incomplete tail. In most respects it compares favorably with
accounts of the species given by Taylor (1936b:55 and 1936c:102). The
frontal is divided by a transverse suture; the enlarged dorsal scales
are arranged in 11 pairs anteriorly, followed by 48 unpaired enlarged
scales. The head and middorsal area are brown; there is a pale tan
stripe on the edges of the vertebral and paravertebral rows, bordered by
a dark brown stripe on the paravertebral row, which, in turn, is
bordered by a pale tan stripe on the lateral edge of the paravertebral
scale row and the median edge of the adjacent scale row. The stripes
extend from the neck to the base of the tail. The flanks are mottled
with brown and cream-color; the labials are cream-color barred by brown;
the venter is a pale cream-color.</p>

<p>Dug&egrave;s (1891:485) described <i>Eumeces altamirani</i> from "las regiones
c&aacute;lidas del Estado de Michoac&aacute;n" and subsequently (1896:480) gave
Apatzing&aacute;n as a locality for the species. Presumably he had only one
specimen. In 1935 Hobart M. Smith collected the species at El Sabino on
the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica bordering the Tepalcatepec
Valley. All of the known specimens are from this valley and the adjacent
slopes, an area to which the species apparently is endemic.</p>

<p>Six males and six females from the Tepalcatepec Valley have more femoral
pores than do 16 males and nine females from the coastal lowlands; the
ranges and average number of femoral pores in the former are 40-50
(44.8) for males and 38-40 (38.6) for females; males from the coast have
34-44 (39.2), and females have 32-40 (36.2) femoral pores. In all
specimens the number of lamellae beneath the fourth toe varies from 26
to 33 (29.7). In life juveniles have a pale olive-tan dorsum and a
dorsolateral dark band, superimposed on which is a row of darker brown
spots. The dorsolateral band is bordered below by a narrow cream-colored
stripe. The tail is tan above and grayish white below; the belly is pale
bluish white. Adult males are brilliantly colored in life. A male having
a snout-vent length of 108 mm. had a rusty brown dorsum and bright blue
bars on the flanks separated by dark brown interspaces. The side of the
head was pale green, and the chin and throat were golden yellow. In some
specimens the throat is orange. Juveniles and subadults have dark flecks
on the brown or tan middorsal area, but these are absent in the largest
males.</p>

<p>This species inhabits the heavily wooded areas in the lowlands to

<p>This small, distinctive species of the <i>sexlineatus</i>-group of
<i>Cnemidophorus</i> was discovered in the Tepalcatepec Valley in 1955
(Duellman, 1955); subsequent field studies showed it to be widespread in
the valley (Duellman, 1960c). One specimen (KU 29747) is from the
relatively arid, low Pacific slope of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, 25
kilometers south of Arteaga. All other specimens have been taken at
elevations of 200 to 650 meters in the Tepalcatepec Valley, where the
species characteristically inhabits the open scrub forests of the valley
floor, especially the <i>Cercidium-Prosopis-Apoplanesia</i> associations,
where there is a sparse growth of grasses. In this habitat it is most
frequently seen in association with <i>Cnemidophorus costatus zweifeli</i>
and <i>C. deppei infernalis</i>.</p>

<p>Aside from the characters given in Table 5, <i>Cnemidophorus calidipes</i>
differs from other species of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> in Michoac&aacute;n by possessing
a complete (or nearly so) supraorbital semicircle-series of granules; in

<p>There is considerable geographic variation in the number of dorsal
granules around the midbody. Sixteen specimens from the coastal regions
of Michoac&aacute;n have 129-146 (136.3) granules; nine from the Tepalcatepec
Valley have 124-137 (128.3), and 44 from Coalcom&aacute;n at an elevation of
950 meters in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, intermediate geographically
between the coast and the Tepalcatepec Valley, have 105-144 (119.7). The
number of granules in specimens from the coast of Michoac&aacute;n compares
favorably with the range of 118-154 (137.8) for 34 specimens from
Colima, Colima (Zweifel, 1959a:107). Aside from the characters given in
Table 5, <i>C. communis communis</i> can be distinguished from other members

<p>Although this is the largest species of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> in Michoac&aacute;n
(adult males attain a snout-vent length of 135 mm.), it is neither
widespread nor abundant. On the coastal lowlands it occurs primarily
with <i>Cnemidophorus lineatissimus lividus</i>. In the coastal lowlands
there is little open scrub forest, a type of habitat that seems to be
preferred by <i>C. communis communis</i>. In the Tepalcatepec Valley, <i>C.
communis communis</i> occurs in the open scrub forest with the more
abundant large species <i>C. costatus</i> (subspecies <i>zweifeli</i>). Only in
the scrub forest in the Coalcom&aacute;n Valley, where no other species of

used the specific name C. <i>costatus</i> for the whiptails on the
southwestern part of the Mexican Plateau (<i>C. c. occidentalis</i>). Since
<i>occidentalis</i> and <i>zweifeli</i> are conspecific, the combination <i>C.
costatus zweifeli</i> is used here for the population inhabiting the
Tepalcatepec Valley.</p>

<p>This lizard is abundant in the Tepalcatepec Valley, where it lives in
open and dense scrub forest, usually at elevations of less than 1000
meters. Throughout the valley it is found in association with
<i>Cnemidophorus deppei infernalis</i>, and in the lower parts of the valley
it also is associated with <i>Cnemidophorus calidipes</i>. Observations made
in the dry season indicate that large adults are not active at that
time.</p>

<p>On the coastal lowlands and in the valleys in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n
<i>Cnemidophorus costatus zweifeli</i> is replaced by <i>C. communis communis</i>.

<p>This is the most abundant and widespread species of <i>Cnemidophorus</i> on
the coastal lowlands of Michoac&aacute;n, where it ranges from sea level to
elevations of about 500 meters. In this area it inhabits dense arid
scrub forest and semi-deciduous broad-leafed forest. Both of these
habitats are continuous, or nearly so, along the lowlands and foothills
of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. This in itself may explain the abundance of
<i>Cnemidophorus lineatissimus</i> and the relative scarcity of <i>C. deppei</i>
and <i>C. communis</i> in the coastal area, for <i>C. deppei</i> and <i>C. communis</i>

rarely exceeding 100 mm. in snout-vent length and always having an
average of less than 100 dorsal granules at midbody and usually less
than 90. Forty-two specimens from the south shore of Lago de Cuitzeo
(UMMZ 119558) have 80-91 (85.8) dorsal granules. Four specimens from 21
kilometers north of Norelia (UIMNH 6952 and UMMZ 104743) have 89, 78,

<p>Specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n are noticeably different from
those inhabiting the mountains rising from the Mexican Plateau. Of 45
specimens from Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro and adjacent areas on the Mexican Plateau
and in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, 15 have twelve longitudinal rows of
dorsal scales and 30 have fourteen rows. Of seven specimens from the
state of M&eacute;xico, 5 have twelve rows and 2 have fourteen; of nine
specimens from central Veracruz, 8 have twelve rows and one has
fourteen; of six specimens from Hidalgo, 5 have twelve rows and one has
sixteen; of two specimens from Guanajuata, one has fourteen and the
other has sixteen rows. All of the 35 specimens from the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n have sixteen rows. Furthermore, these specimens have the
superciliary row extended anteriorly, so that the anterior superciliary
is in broad contact with the loreal. Specimens from Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro have
a shorter superciliary row, so that the anterior superciliary is not in
broad contact with the loreal. These characters were used by Tihen
(1949:220) to distinguish <i>Gerrhonotus imbricatus ciliaris</i> from <i>G.
imbricatus imbricatus</i>. According to Tihen, the subspecies <i>G.
imbricatus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> ciliaris</i> ranges from Guanajuato and Hidalgo northward to
Chihuahua and Coahuila, whereas the nominal subspecies occurs from
Michoac&aacute;n and Hidalgo southward to Oaxaca. Specimens from the Sierra de
Autl&aacute;n in Jalisco are like those from Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro; consequently,
there seems to be no connection between the populations of <i>G.
imbricatus ciliaris</i> in the mountains of the northern part of the
Mexican Plateau with the <i>ciliaris</i>-like individuals found in the Sierra
de Coalcom&aacute;n. The acquisition and study of additional material from
throughout the range of the species is necessary to clarify the picture
of geographic variation. Until then, I prefer to consider all of the
specimens from Michoac&aacute;n as <i>Gerrhonotus imbricatus imbricatus</i>.</p>

<p>The largest specimen is a male having a snout-vent length of 136 mm. Two
juveniles collected in July 24, 1960, have snout-vent lengths of 36 and
42 mm. A specimen having a snout-vent length of 127 mm. and a tail
length of 145 mm. was regurgitated by a <i>Crotalus pusillus</i>, which had a
body length of 550 mm.</p>

<p><i>Gerrhonotus imbricatus imbricatus</i> is an inhabitant of coniferous
forests. In the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica it occurs from 1500 to 3500 meters
at the top of Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro. In the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n it occurs from
2100 to 2700 meters. On July 4, 1955, a pair was found in copulation
beneath a pine log at 2700 meters on Cerro Barolosa. The male was lying
on top of the female and was holding her head firmly in his jaws; the
male's tail was curled under the female's tail, so that the cloacae were
in contact.</p>

introduced into M&eacute;xico at the time that vessels were stopping at
Acapulco from the Philippines (Taylor, 1940b:444), but instead may
indicate that pack trains from Acapulco passed through the Sierra de

camp is unknown, the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica above
Apatzing&aacute;n usually support arid scrub forest at elevations below 1000

scrub forest.</p>

<p>As noted by Peters (1954:21), this species was not recorded from
Michoac&aacute;n by Smith and Taylor (1945:27), but Gadow (1930:30) collected a
specimen at La Orilla in 1908. This specimen (BMNH<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> 1914.1.28.124) is a
male having 235 ventrals and 47 caudals, a dark brown dorsum, and
cream-colored labials and venter. The anterior chin-shields are
considerably longer than the scales bordering the chin-shields. In these
characters this specimen agrees with the diagnosis of <i>Loxocemus
bicolor</i> given by Taylor (1940c:447), who revived <i>Loxocemus
sumichrasti</i> Bocourt. Of the six specimens from Apatzing&aacute;n in the
Tepalcatepec Valley, three males have 243 to 253 (246.6) ventrals and 44
to 45 (44.3) caudals; three females have 238 to 247 (244.0) ventrals and
42 to 44 (43.0) caudals. Certain characters of scutellation utilized by
Taylor for separating <i>L. bicolor</i> and <i>L. sumichrasti</i> are inconsistent
in this series. The chin-shields are longer than the adjacent scales,
like those illustrated in <i>L. bicolor</i> by Taylor (<i>op. cit.</i>, fig. 1).
The relative lengths of the prefrontal and internasal sutures are
subequal, or the prefrontal suture is slightly longer. Thus, in these
characters of scutellation these snakes are like <i>L. bicolor</i>, but in
coloration they are like <i>L. sumichrasti</i>; the dorsal color in life was
an iridescent dark bluish gray, and the belly was pale gray or bluish
gray.</p>

<p>The supposed differences in scutellation between <i>L. bicolor</i> and <i>L.
sumichrasti</i> have been questioned by Woodbury and Woodbury (1944:360);
these authors treated <i>L. sumichrasti</i> as a subspecies of <i>L. bicolor</i>.
As pointed out by Zweifel (1959b:5), such an arrangement is not tenable,
for, although individuals with each kind of color pattern have not been
collected together at any one locality, the over-all geographic picture
is one of sympatric distribution. Only snakes having the coloration of
<i>L. sumichrasti</i> have been collected in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin. I
agree with Zweifel (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that on the basis of morphological
similarities and sympatric distribution, <i>L. bicolor</i> and <i>L.
sumichrasti</i> seem to be dimorphic phases of the same species, showing no
more striking differences in coloration than <i>Lampropeltis getulus
californiae</i>, a now classical example of pattern dimorphism in snakes.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n, as in other parts of its range, <i>Loxocemus bicolor</i>
inhabits arid scrub forest environments at low elevations.</p>

<p>The few specimens indicate that in Michoac&aacute;n, as elsewhere on the
Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico, this species is restricted to forested regions
on the coastal plain. It does not occur in the Tepalcatepec Valley.</p>

<p>The coloration, in life, of a juvenile (UMMZ 114604) is as follows: The
dorsum is uniform pale grayish tan on posterior one-third of body and on
tail; anteriorly there are pale grayish tan middorsal blotches separated
by grayish white interspaces, which are about one-half the length of the
blotches. Posteriorly the blotches are less distinct, fading into the
uniform grayish tan ground color of the posterior part of the body. The
blotches extend laterally onto the fourth and fifth scale rows. Large
squarish lateral intercalary blotches of darker brown interconnect with
the dorsal blotches. The top of the head is pale olive-brown; a dark
brown postorbital stripe extends from the eye to the posterior edge of
the last upper labial. The labials, chin, and ventrals 1-30 are creamy
white, changing to a dusty cream-color posteriorly; the chin and
ventrals 1-30 are heavily spotted with dark brown. The iris is a
cream-color above and chocolate brown below; the tongue is blue.</p>

<p>Not all of the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n are typical in color pattern of
this subspecies, as defined by Smith (1941a:475). All specimens from the
Tepalcatepec Valley are uniformly black above; they have reddish or
cream-colored chins and the anterior two-thirds of the belly salmon-pink
or reddish buff. Individuals from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n (Arteaga and
Arroyo El Salto) are like those from the Tepalcatepec Valley. Three
specimens from the coastal lowlands differ noticeably in color pattern:</p>

<p>UMMZ 104504, adult male (Ostula).&mdash;Pale brown above flecked with black
anteriorly; at midbody, flecks form narrow transverse bands that become
progressively wider posteriorly, until on tail no brown pigment evident,
all ventrals reddish buff, except last eight, which are black.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>UMMZ 104602, adult female (La Placita).&mdash;Black above, reddish
cross-bands and flecks on all of body; dorsal and ventral surfaces of
tail black; chin cream-color and entire belly reddish buff.</p>

<p>UMMZ 114626, adult male (San Juan de Lima).&mdash;Black above; dull
rust-colored cross-bands on anterior half of body; chin white; belly
rust-colored on anterior two-thirds of body and black posteriorly.</p>

<p>One specimen from La Palma on the Mexican Plateau (KU 29275) has the top
of the head an olive-color, the entire dorsum black, the chin and
ventrals 1-42 a cream-color, remainder of venter black, and all of the
labials heavily barred with black. A juvenile from Capirio in the
Tepalcatepec Valley (UMMZ 114627) is black above and has pale
olive-colored flecks on the anterior one-third of the body; the top of
the head is dark olive-brown, and the sides of the head are somewhat
paler. Anteriorly the belly is a cream-color; posteriorly it is black.</p>

<p>The specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley are typical of <i>Drymarchon
corais rubidus</i>. Those from the coastal lowlands differ in having large
areas of brown or red pigment on the dorsum, a condition not mentioned
by Smith in his description of the subspecies. The specimen from La
Palma, like many others from various localities on the Mexican Plateau,
resembles in certain characters <i>D. corais orizabensis</i> (Smith, <i>op.
cit.</i>: 477). Our knowledge of the geographical variation in coloration
in this species is incomplete; many populations have been assigned to
subspecific rank without justification.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species is found from sea level to 1350 meters in the
Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and to 1300 meters at La Palma on Lago de Chapala.
It has been collected in scrub forest, semi-deciduous broad-leafed
forest, and oak forest.</p>

<p>This snake is abundant in the lowlands of the state; the few specimens
listed above are indicative not of the rarity, but rather of the speed
and agility, of this diurnal snake. It most frequently is found near
water, where there is a dense growth of vegetation. One individual was

another was seen along the bank of a hyacinth-choked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> river channel. A

<p>Dowling (1960) has shown that specimens from the Balsas-Tepalcatepec
Basin have fewer ventrals and caudals than those from the Sierra del Sur
or the coast. All specimens from Michoac&aacute;n were collected in open
forest, either scrub or oak forest. They were found in drier situations
than those described for the species in southern Tamaulipas by Martin
(1958:69). In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Elaphe triaspis intermedia</i> is known from the
Tepalcatepec Valley, the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, and
the western edge of the Mexican Plateau at an elevation of 1350 meters.
It probably occurs in the lower parts of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and
along the Pacific coast, for it is known from the coastal lowlands of
Guerrero and Colima. In August, 1951, I saw a snake that probably was
this species in Barranca de Bejuco.</p>

<p>Previously this species was known definitely only from the Plains of

<i>Geagras redimitus</i> Cope. Although Fischer gave the type locality only
as "Mazatl&aacute;n" and did not designate the state, it is probable that the
type originated from Mazatl&aacute;n, Sinaloa. The present specimens are from a
locality almost midway between Tehuantepec and Mazatl&aacute;n and support the
possibility that <i>Geagras</i> ranges along the Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico from
Oaxaca to Sinaloa.</p>

<p>The two specimens from Michoac&aacute;n (UMMZ 114446-7), both males, have 118
and 122 ventrals, 31 and 33 caudals, body lengths of 108 and 81 mm., and

1-2 temporals, 6-6 upper labials, and 5-5 lower labials. In life, the
dorsum was pale tan; the top of the head and the middorsal and lateral

triangular supraocular. The specimen from Coalcom&aacute;n (UMMZ 104698) was
referred to <i>Geophis nasalis</i> by Peters (1954:22). This specimen is
abnormal in several characters; in five places there is a fusion and
separation of the vertebral and paravertebral scale rows, producing a
change from 17 to 15 rows of dorsal scales. Fusion of the three rows
takes place at the level of the 8th, 41st, 47th, 54th, and 65th
ventrals. Furthermore, there is a small secondary postocular on each

<p>Tup&aacute;taro.</p></div>

<p>The systematic status of the geographic variants of <i>Hypsiglena</i> in
M&eacute;xico and southwestern United States has been commented on by several
authors. Tanner (1944) considered <i>H. torquata</i> and <i>H. ochrorhyncha</i> to
be distinct species; Bogert and Oliver (1945:379) and Duellman
(1957b:238) presented evidence indicating that <i>H. torquata</i> and <i>H.
ochrorhyncha</i> intergrade in Sinaloa and southern Sonora. In <i>Hypsiglena</i>
the scutellation, including the numbers of labials, dorsals, ventrals,
and caudals, seem to vary in a clinal manner. Nevertheless, these snakes
can be divided into two distinct populations on the basis of the nuchal
color pattern, consisting of an <i>ochrorhyncha</i>-type (a broad dark
nape-band, the lateral edges of which extend anteriorly and fuse with a
postorbital stripe, and a narrow nape stripe extending from the
posteromedian edges of the parietals to the dark nape band) and a
<i>torquata</i>-type (a somewhat narrower dark nape-band bordered anteriorly
by a pale nuchal area, and no dark nape stripe). Snakes having the
<i>ochrorhyncha</i>-type of nuchal pattern are found on the Mexican Plateau
from Michoac&aacute;n northward into the desert regions of Sonora and the
southwestern United States. Snakes having the <i>torquata</i>-type of pattern
are found on the coastal lowlands and adjacent slopes of the Sierra
Madre Occidental from southern Sinaloa to Colima and thence inland in
the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin to Morelos and Guerrero. An exception is
<i>Hypsiglena torquata dunklei</i> from Forl&oacute;n and San Fernando, Tamaulipas;
it has the <i>torquata</i>-type of nuchal pattern. The distributional picture
is somewhat complicated because some individuals having the
<i>torquata</i>-type of nuchal pattern also have a faint nape stripe. If
these are taken as exceptions, the general picture of distribution in
M&eacute;xico is <i>H. t. torquata</i> on the Pacific lowlands from Sinaloa
southward to the Balsas Basin and <i>H. t. ochrorhyncha</i> on the Mexican
Plateau.</p>

<p>Smith (1943:433) resurrected <i>Hypsiglena jani</i> Dug&egrave;s for the snakes of
the <i>ochrorhyncha</i>-type on the southern part of the Mexican<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> Plateau. He
stated that the southern specimens differed from northern ones in having
a nuchal spot 9 or 10 scales in length, as compared with a spot 2 to 6
scales in length in northern specimens. A cursory examination of
specimens from the areas between Arizona and Michoac&aacute;n showed that there
is a gradual increase in the size of the spot from north to south. If no
other characters can be found to distinguish the populations, they
should be considered as a single subspecies.</p>

<p><i>Hypsiglena affinis</i> differs from <i>H. torquata</i> in possessing 19 instead
of 21 rows of dorsal scales. Additional material is needed from the
western slopes of Jalisco and the Barrancas in Zacatecas and Durango,
before definite allocation of <i>affinis</i> can be made.</p>

<p>Bogert and Oliver (1945:379) discussed the status of certain named
populations in Baja California and concluded that only one species
occurs there, and that the species probably is conspecific with <i>H.
torquata</i>. A careful review of the genus <i>Hypsiglena</i> might show that
there is only one species.</p>

features of coloration it was like <i>I. g. latistratus</i>. There are too
few specimens of this species to define the ranges of the various

<p>The few specimens of this species from Michoac&aacute;n show a wide range of
variation; furthermore, the present systematic status of the subspecies
of <i>Lampropeltis doliata</i> portrays an incongruous pattern of
distribution. Specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n have relatively
narrow red bands that are not interrupted dorsally by extensions of the
black rings; the scales in the red bands have black tips. The specimen
from El Sabino (EHT-HMS 5253) and the one from the R&iacute;o Nexpa on the
coast (USNM 31491) have broader red bands; the scales in the red bands
do not have black tips. A specimen from 24 kilometers west of Morelia
(UIMNH 17782) and one from Uruapan (UMMZ 121508) have the red bands
interrupted dorsally by extensions from the black rings.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n were referred to <i>L. doliata
blanchardi</i> by Peters (1954:24), who noted that in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> characters
these snakes were like <i>L. d. nelsoni</i> and in others like <i>L. d.
polyzona</i>. The individual from El Sabino was referred to <i>L. d. nelsoni</i>
by Taylor (1940c:465); the one from 24 kilometers west of Morelia was
referred to <i>L. d. arcifera</i> by Smith (1942c:198). If these assignments
are correct, three subspecies of <i>Lampropeltis doliata</i> occur in
Michoac&aacute;n: <i>blanchardi</i> in the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, <i>nelsoni</i> on the
coast and in the Tepalcatepec Valley, and <i>arcifera</i> on the Mexican
Plateau and in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. Such a distribution is
plausible, but the few specimens and our general lack of knowledge of
the variation and relationships of the different populations do not
permit a definite assignment at this time.</p>

<p>This snake is abundant in the arid Tepalcatepec Valley; most of the
specimens have been collected in arid scrub forest at elevations of less
than 500 meters. With the onset of the rains in late June and early
July, large numbers of these snakes can be found around temporary pools,
where they feed on small frogs and toads. In the dry season few
individuals were found, and all of those were beneath cover. Specimens
from the coast have more body-blotches than do those from the
Tepalcatepec Valley (Duellman, 1958a:56); otherwise the snakes show
little variation.</p>

<p>This is one of the most abundant snakes in the arid lowlands of the
Tepalcatepec Valley; observations indicate that it probably is equally
abundant on the coastal lowlands. Near Apatzing&aacute;n as many as five of
these snakes have been seen in one-half hour. The snakes seem to be
equally abundant and active in the dry season and in the rainy season.
Most individuals were seen on the ground, but two were found in low
trees. On several occasions <i>Salvadora mexicana</i> was observed in pursuit
of lizards on the ground. Captured individuals regurgitated
<i>Cnemidophorus costatus zweifeli</i>, <i>Cnemidophorus deppei infernalis</i>,
<i>Sceloporus horridus oligoporus</i>, <i>Sceloporus pyrocephalus</i>, and
<i>Urosaurus gadowi</i>.</p>

<p>These specimens, together with all known specimens from the Sierra del
Sur in Guerrero (KU 23790-1, MVZ 45123) and the upper Balsas Basin in
Puebla (UIMNH 41688), are referable to <i>S. m. michoacanensis</i>. The
dorsal pattern consists of a highly variable number of cross-bands of
red, white, and black. In the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n there are as many
as 17 red cross-bands on the body. One specimen from Apatzing&aacute;n (CNHM
37141) has just behind the head a white band, bordered on either side by
a narrow black band; posteriorly the body is uniform red. Two specimens
from Coalcom&aacute;n (UMMZ 109905-6) have respectively 11 and 13 red
cross-bands and 20 and 17 white cross-bands, and the posterior part of
the body is devoid of red color. Other specimens from these localities
have red, black, and white cross-bands throughout the length of the
body.</p>

<p><i>Sonora michoacanensis michoacanensis</i> is distinguished from <i>S.
michoacanensis mutabilis</i> by the presence of cross-bands on the tail in
the latter (Stickel, 1943:116). One specimen from Coalcom&aacute;n (UMMZ

lives in foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental from southern Jalisco

<p>The generic status of <i>Toluca</i> is unsettled. Taylor and Smith (1942b)
separated <i>Toluca</i> from <i>Conopsis</i> by the presence of enlarged and
grooved posterior maxillary teeth in <i>Toluca</i> and their absence in
<i>Conopsis</i>. Bogert and Oliver (1945:378) suggested synonymizing <i>Toluca</i>
with <i>Conopsis</i>. Smith and Laufe (1945:12) defined the generic position
of <i>Toluca</i>. Actually, in deciding the generic position of these snakes,
five genera (<i>Ficimia</i>, <i>Gyalopion</i>, <i>Pseudoficimia</i>, <i>Conopsis</i>, and
<i>Toluca</i>) must be considered. Of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> <i>Ficimia</i> and <i>Gyalopion</i> are
closely related; they have been placed in one genus by some workers.
<i>Pseudoficimia</i> is intermediate between <i>Ficimia-Gyalopion</i> and
<i>Toluca-Conopsis</i>. A workable definition of the supraspecific
classification of these snakes must await a thorough review of the
species.</p>

<p>In the arid lowlands of the Tepalcatepec Valley and presumably also in
the scrub forest of the coastal lowlands, this is an abundant snake,
which is active only at night. Usually snakes of this species are found
on the ground, but one large individual was observed at night in a low
tree. That individual defied capture by widely opening its mouth and
striking repeatedly at the collector. The excreta of one specimen
contained feathers of an unidentified species of bird.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n this species has been collected in semi-arid habitats at
elevations from 300 to 1430 meters in the Tepalcatepec Valley and lower
slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. In this area it occurs sympatrically
with <i>Trimorphodon biscutatus biscutatus</i>.</p>

<p>In life, adults have a pale tan dorsal ground color and rich chocolate
brown cross-bands; the eye is pale grayish tan. A juvenile from
Coalcom&aacute;n has black cross-bands on a pale grayish tan ground color. As
stated by Schmidt and Shannon (1947:83) and Peters (1954:32), the type
specimen of <i>Trimorphodon fasciolata</i> Smith from Cascada Tzararacua is
indistinguishable from specimens of <i>Trimorphodon latifascia</i>.</p>

tau</i> on the Mexican Plateau. In fact, additional specimens from the
headwaters of the Tepalcatepec Valley and the lower slopes of the

<p>Two of the specimens from Michoac&aacute;n (UMMZ 118948 from Tangamandapio and
UIMNH 19138 from Tac&iacute;cuaro) have cream-colored, Y-shaped marks on the
head. These markings supposedly are characteristic of <i>Trimorphodon
upsilon</i>. One specimen from Emiliano Zapata (UMMZ 118950) and one from
between Morelia and Ciudad Hidalgo (EHT-HMS 21402) have a cream-colored
line on the parietal suture; in another specimen from Emiliano Zapata
(UMMZ 118949) the anterior end of this line is expanded, giving the
appearance of an incipient "Y". Thus, the nature of the markings on the
head in specimens from Michoac&aacute;n is intermediate between the typical
condition in <i>Trimorphodon tau</i> and the usual condition in <i>T. upsilon</i>.
Smith and Taylor (1945:148) gave the range of <i>Trimorphodon tau</i> as:
"Central Guerrero, in the Sierra Madre del Sur; central Oaxaca; and the
edge of the plateau in central Michoac&aacute;n." They gave the range of
<i>Trimorphodon upsilon</i> as: "Southern Chihuahua south to central
Michoac&aacute;n, east to central Hidalgo." Specimens referable to <i>T. tau</i>
have been found at La Joya de Salas, near Ciudad Victoria, and near
Llera, Tamaulipas (see Smith and Darling, 1952:85, and Martin, 1958:74).
Some of these specimens also show combinations of characteristics of <i>T.
tau</i> and <i>T. upsilon</i>. Smith and Darling (<i>loc. cit.</i>) suggested that
<i>T. tau</i> and <i>T. upsilon</i> be considered as subspecies. However, if <i>T.
tau</i> and <i>T. upsilon</i> are subspecies, intergrades would be expected
between the ranges of the two populations and not on the northeastern
and southwestern periphery of their combined ranges. Instead, the
limited evidence now available suggests that <i>T. tau</i> and <i>T. upsilon</i>
are names based on a highly variable character of color pattern of the
head, and that only one species is involved.</p>

(136.4) ventrals, and 43-48 (44.7) and 38-44 (40.2) caudals. These data
show that, although there is little difference in the number of caudals,
specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n have fewer ventrals than do
specimens from the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica. Of eleven specimens from the

<p>The snakes comprising the former <i>Thamnophis eques</i>-group have undergone
extensive taxonomic and nomenclatural shuffling by Smith (1942 and
1951), Bogert and Oliver (1945), Milstead (1953), and Fitch and Milstead
(1961). Smith recognized in Michoac&aacute;n three members of the <i>T. eques</i> (=
<i>dorsalis</i>) complex: <i>eques eques</i>, <i>eques postremus</i>, and <i>vicinus</i>.
Later, Smith (1951) showed that the specific name <i>eques</i> had been
misapplied, so that <i>T. eques eques</i> became <i>T. cyrtopsis cyclides</i>, and
<i>T. eques postremus</i> became <i>T. cyrtopsis postremus</i>; under this
arrangement <i>T. vicinus</i> stood unchanged. In the meantime, Bogert and
Oliver (1945:359) presented a reinterpretation of Smith's data and
suggested that <i>T. vicinus</i>, which differs from <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>
only in lacking a middorsal stripe, "... is not a species, but only a
pattern phase, possibly a simple mutant of <i>T. e. eques</i>" (= <i>T.
dorsalis cyclides</i>, by present arrangement). Milstead (1953) agreed with
Bogert and Oliver on the status of <i>T. vicinus</i>; furthermore, on the
basis of only a few specimens, Milstead concluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> that <i>T. cyrtopsis
postremus</i> was not subspecifically distinct from <i>T. cyrtopsis
cyclides</i>. Recently, Fitch and Milstead (1961) showed that <i>Thamnophis
dorsalis</i> Baird and Girard (1853) was the correct name for the snakes
that had been recognized as <i>Thamnophis cyrtopsis</i> Kennicott (1860).
Consequently, the snakes referred to <i>T. eques eques</i> by Smith (1942)
and to <i>T. cyrtopsis cyclides</i> by Smith (1951) and Milstead (1953) are
now <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>.</p>

<p>Aside from one specimen from Temazcal and nine from Morelia (paratypes
of <i>T. vicinus</i>), only two other specimens completely lacking the
middorsal stripe have been seen; one is a male (UMMZ 102510) having 161
ventrals and an incomplete tail from Pino Gordo, and the other is a male
(CNHM 39060) from Tanc&iacute;taro having 158 ventrals and an incomplete tail.
A female from Tanc&iacute;taro (CNHM 39061) having 153 ventrals and 77 caudals
has no lateral stripes and only a narrow middorsal stripe on the
anterior part of the body. Throughout the region where <i>T. vicinus</i>-like
snakes have been found, typical <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i> occurs in much
greater numbers. I concur with Bogert and Oliver in placing <i>T. vicinus</i>
as a synonym of <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>.</p>

<p>Milstead (1953) had available few specimens of <i>Thamnophis dorsalis</i>
from the Tepalcatepec Valley. The large series now in existence shows
that the population in the Tepalcatepec Valley differs distinctly from
that inhabiting the Mexican Plateau, Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica, and Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n. Therefore the name <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i> Smith (1942) is
resurrected for the population<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> in the Tepalcatepec Valley. <i>T. dorsalis
cyclides</i> and <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i> differ in color pattern (Fig. 10)
and in scutellation (Table 6). Specimens from the Mexican Plateau and
mountain ranges have a distinct light stripe on the second and third
scale rows, a dark brown dorsum having squarish black spots, and a row
of dark spots on the first row of dorsal scales. Specimens from the
Tepalcatepec Valley have a grayish brown dorsum having smaller and less
distinct dark spots and no light stripe on the second and third scale
rows; the first, second, and third rows of scales are colored like the
venter. In some specimens there are small dark flecks on the first row
of dorsal scales.</p>

<p>One specimen from Uruapan (1550 meters) and one from Coalcom&aacute;n (950
meters) are intermediate in color pattern between <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>
and <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i>. Both have indistinct lateral stripes and
only small dark spots below the stripes. In scutellation these specimens
are like <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>.</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Thamnophis dorsalis cyclides</i> has been collected in a
variety of habitats on the Mexican Plateau: pine-oak forest, fir forest,
marshes, and cleared land from 1550 to 2800 meters. In the Sierra de
Coalcom&aacute;n one was taken in broad-leafed forest at 950 meters, three in
pine-oak forest at 2100 meters, and one in pine forest at 2300 meters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The reasons for recognizing the population of <i>Thamnophis dorsalis</i> in
the Tepalcatepec Valley as distinct from that on the surrounding
highlands are presented in the discussion of <i>Thamnophis dorsalis
cyclides</i>. In certain features of coloration and in the low numbers of
ventrals and caudals, <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i> shows more resemblance to
<i>T. dorsalis sumichrasti</i> than to <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i>. According to
Milstead (1953:367), <i>T. dorsalis cyclides</i> ranges southward from the
R&iacute;o Balsas in southwestern M&eacute;xico. If specimens could be obtained from
the upper Balsas Basin they might show that <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i>
inhabits that extensive basin.</p>

<p>In the Tepalcatepec Valley <i>T. dorsalis postremus</i> is most frequently
found at night in the rainy season, at which time the snakes are
abundant near temporary pools where frogs are breeding. The absence of
specimens from the coastal lowlands of Guerrero, Michoac&aacute;n, and Colima
indicate that, although the species inhabits the lowlands of the
Tepalcatepec Valley, its range does not include the coastal lowlands.</p>

<p>A female (UMMZ 119402 from Cuatro Caminos) having 139 ventrals and a
body length of 576 mm., on June 20, 1958, gave birth to 25 young, of
which 18 (9 males and 9 females) were preserved. In body length the
males varied from 132 to 141 (137.3) mm.; the females, 125 to 137
(133.1) mm. In tail length the males varied from 38 to 44 (42.4) mm.;
females, 35 to 42 (39.7) mm. The males have 138 to 147 (142.2) ventrals
and 70 to 75 (72.9) caudals; females have 131 to 140 (135.8) ventrals

At these elevations (1550 to 2200 meters) it often is found in
association with <i>Thamnophis eques eques</i> and sometimes with <i>Thamnophis

found in a hyacinth-choked marsh at Tangamandapio at night.</p>

<p>One specimen from Tangamandapio (UMMZ 119414) had, in life, a dark

<p>In November, 1955, Alfonzo Gonzales, a geographer from the University of
Texas, observed sea snakes on the beaches of Michoac&aacute;n. In May, 1956,
Donald D. Brand of the University of Texas gave me one specimen of
<i>Pelamis platurus</i> that he obtained on March 2, 1956, at Boca de Apiza.
Furthermore, he supplied me with the following observations based on his
field work along the coast of Michoac&aacute;n from the R&iacute;o Coahuayana to
Maruata from March 1, to April 15, 1956. At that time many sea snakes
were observed; in some places living and dead individuals were seen on
the beaches; innumerable snakes were seen in the surf. When live
individuals were taken from the beach and thrown into the ocean, they
usually swam to shore. Many partially eaten individuals were seen
protruding from crab holes. Inquiries among the natives resulted in the
following information: Sea snakes are frequently seen between November
and April, but most commonly in March and April, at which time the water
is cold. The natives referred to the sea snakes as "culebra del mar."
Most natives said that the snakes were not poisonous; others did not
know of any venomous properties. In May, 1956, I worked the coastal
region from the R&iacute;o Coahuayana to La Placita and saw no sea snakes. In
the summer of 1950 James A. Peters, and in the summer of 1951 I worked
nearly the entire coastal region of Michoac&aacute;n; during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> that time no

<p>All specimens from Michoac&aacute;n are from inland localities between 300 and
1500 meters. The one from Los Reyes (USNM 46416) was collected by Nelson
and Goldman on February 13, 1903. The elevation of Los Reyes (1500
meters) seems unusually high for this species, but otherwise there is no
reason to doubt the authenticity of the record. Goldman (1951:192) in
his description of Los Reyes stated: "Los Reyes is near the boundary
between the Lower Austral and Arid Upper Tropical Zones but is
preponderantly tropical in zonal character. The regular crops are mainly
sugar cane, rice, and corn." Thus the biotic features of the area are
not noticeably different from those at El Sabino and La Playa at lower
elevations. The development of extensive agriculture through irrigation
in the Tepalcatepec Valley and planting of rice and sugar-cane in that
area may produce a more widespread habitat for this snake.</p>

<p>The absence of specimens from the coastal lowlands is due solely to
inadequate collecting; the natives there know the snake and report that
it is not uncommon in certain areas.</p>

<p>Specimens from southern Michoac&aacute;n have fewer ventrals and caudals than
do those from the northern part of the range; three males and three
females have, respectively, 178, 182, 182, 185, 186, and 188 ventrals,
and 27, 28, 29, 22, 29, and 29 caudals. Klauber (1952:81) gave the
following data for <i>Crotalus basiliscus</i> (based on specimens from the
entire range, except Oaxaca): ventrals in males, 179-201 (191.4), in
females, 185-206 (197.6); caudals in males, 26-36 (30.7), in females,
21-29 (24.4). Klauber (1952:84) remarked that the one specimen that he
had seen from Apatzing&aacute;n<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> had fewer ventrals and caudals than most other
specimens. The low numbers of ventrals and caudals in specimens from
Michoac&aacute;n, as compared with more northern populations, may be indicative
of a trend in the reduction of the numbers of these scutes from north to
south. The southernmost examples of <i>Crotalus basiliscus</i> (<i>Crotalus
basiliscus oaxacus</i> from Oaxaca) have 172-175 ventrals and 21 caudals
(Gloyd, 1948).</p>

<p>In Michoac&aacute;n <i>Crotalus basiliscus basiliscus</i> has been found in arid

<p>Aside from the type series of <i>Crotalus pusillus</i> from Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro
and one specimen from Carapan referred to the species by Klauber
(1952:38), there are fourteen specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n.
These specimens (UMMZ 112566-7, 118591-9, 118601, 121512-3) are like
<i>Crotalus pusillus</i> from Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro in having the prefrontals
paired, a black proximal rattle, and the underside of the tail black.
The prefrontals are bordered posteriorly by one scale in two specimens,
by two scales in three specimens, and by three scales in the other nine.
The snakes from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n have 40 to 46 (42) dorsal body
blotches. Ten males have 150-158 (154.4) ventrals and 29-33 (31.0)
caudals; two females have 157 and 160 ventrals, and 25 and 27 caudals.
The largest specimen is a male having a body length of 545 mm. and a
tail length of 63 mm. The only noticeable difference between the
specimens from the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n and the topotypic series is that
the latter have fewer dorsal blotches; the range of variation is 33 to
46 (39.8).</p>

<p>Most specimens of this species have a grayish brown dorsum and dark
brown dorsal blotches. Two specimens from Dos Aguas (UMMZ 118596 and

associated open pine-oak or oak-bunch grass habitats to the north and

<p>This small rattlesnake inhabits rocky areas in pine and pine-oak forests
above 1600 meters in the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica; it has been collected at
3270 meters on Cerro Tanc&iacute;taro. The series reported by Schmidt and
Shannon (1947:84) is a mixture of specimens of <i>Crotalus triseriatus</i>
and <i>Crotalus pusillus</i>. The two species are found together on Cerro
Tanc&iacute;taro, but only <i>Crotalus pusillus</i> inhabits the coniferous forests
of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n. Klauber (1952:30) stated that despite the
proximity of <i>Crotalus triseriatus triseriatus</i> and <i>Crotalus
triseriatus aquilus</i> in Michoac&aacute;n, there is no evidence of
intergradation. He went on to suggest that additional material might
show that the two named populations actually are distinct species. The
specimens that have been studied since Klauber's investigations also
show no evidence of intergradation, but there still is no known sympatry
of the populations.</p>

distribution and relationships of the various populations of these
snakes, together with other species also living in isolated populations
on the higher mountains in M&eacute;xico, probably will be of great
significance in understanding dispersal and differentiation of animals
during the Pleistocene.</p>

<h2>SPECIES OF QUESTIONABLE OCCURRENCE</h2>


<p>Some species for which there are no authentic records from Michoac&aacute;n can
be expected there on zoogeographic probability. Other species have been
recorded from Michoac&aacute;n, but these records are doubtful for any one of
several reasons. Fifteen species of such questionable occurrence are
discussed below:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Syrrhophus modestus modestus</b> Taylor</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Syrrhophus modestus</i> Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,
28:304, May 15, 1942.&mdash;Hacienda Paso del R&iacute;o, Colima,
M&eacute;xico.</p>

<p><i>Syrrhophus modestus modestus</i>, Duellman, Occ. Pap. Mus.
Zool. Univ. Michigan, 594:5, June 6, 1958.</p></div>

<p>This small terrestrial frog is not uncommon on the coastal lowlands and
foothills in Nayarit and in Colima, where it has been collected within a
few kilometers of the Michoac&aacute;n border. At Tecolapa, Colima, on August
9, 1956, <i>Syrrhophus modestus modestus</i> was found with <i>Tomodactylus
nitidus orarius</i>, <i>Bufo marinus</i>, <i>Bufo marmoreus</i>, <i>Hyla baudini</i>,
<i>Hyla smithi</i>, and <i>Phyllomedusa dacnicolor</i>, all of which occur on the
coastal lowlands of Michoac&aacute;n. Because of its solitary and secretive
habits, <i>Syrrhophus modestus modestus</i> is not common in collections.
Additional field work on the coast of Michoac&aacute;n should reveal the
presence of the species there.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Hyla microcephala sartori</b> Smith</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Hyla microcephala sartori</i> Smith, Herpetologica, 7:186,
December 31, 1951.&mdash;1 mi. N of Organos, S of El Triente,
Guerrero, M&eacute;xico.</p></div>

<p>On August 28, 1960, J. R. Dixon obtained a series of this species from a
temporary pond 6 kilometers northeast of La Resolana, Jalisco.
Previously, <i>Hyla microcephala sartori</i> had been known only from the
lowlands of Guerrero and Oaxaca. The existence of the species in Jalisco
provides evidence that this frog also occurs in Michoac&aacute;n and Colima.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Gastrophryne usta usta</b> (Cope)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Engystoma ustum</i> Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,

<p>Smith and Taylor (1948:93-4) listed specimens of this species from
Organos and El Treinta, Guerrero, and from Paso del R&iacute;o,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> Queser&iacute;a,
Santiago, and Tecom&aacute;n, Colima. The species occurs from Sinaloa and
central Veracruz southward at low elevations to the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec and thence along the Pacific lowlands into Central America.
Almost certainly it occurs on the coastal lowlands in Michoac&aacute;n. Since
the amphibian fauna of the Tepalcatepec Valley has been better sampled
than that of the coast, I suspect that if <i>Gastrophryne</i> occurred in the
Tepalcatepec Valley, I would have found it there.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Lepidochelys olivacea</b> (Eschscholtz)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Chelonia olivacea</i> Eschscholtz, Zool. Atlas, pt. 1, p. 2,

<p><i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i>, Girard, United States Exploring
Expedition..., vol. 20, Herpetology, p. 435, 1858.</p></div>

<p>According to Smith and Taylor (1950b: 15), this sea turtle is known from
the entire Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico; these authors reported the species
from Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Colima, and Sonora. Although the only
sea turtle that I observed in Michoac&aacute;n is <i>Chelonia mydas</i>, others
probably do use the sheltered beaches for nesting. The scanty records of
sea turtles along the Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico indicate that <i>Chelonia
mydas</i> and <i>Lepidochelys olivacea</i> are the most abundant species in that
region. There are scattered records of <i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>, <i>Caretta
caretta</i>, and <i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i> along the Pacific coast. The
occurrence of any of these along the coast of Michoac&aacute;n is probable.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Geoemyda pulcherrima pulcherrima</b> (Gray)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Emys pulcherrima</i> Gray, Catalogue of the Shield Reptiles in
British Museum, vol. 1, p. 25.&mdash;M&eacute;xico. Type locality
restricted to Presidio de Mazatl&aacute;n, Sinaloa, M&eacute;xico, by
Smith and Taylor (1950b:30).</p>

<p><i>Geoemyda pulcherrima pulcherrima</i>, Wettstein, Sitzb. Akad.
Wiss. Wien, 143:18, 1934.</p></div>

<p>Smith and Taylor (1950b:30) recorded this species from Sonora, Sinaloa,
Nayarit, Colima, and Guerrero; these records indicate that the species
probably is distributed along the Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico southward from
southern Sonora. It unquestionably occurs on the coast of Michoac&aacute;n.
Natives of the coastal lowlands tell of another "tortuga de la tierra"
besides <i>Geoemyda rubida</i>. In the collections of the Museum of Natural
History of the University of Illinois is a specimen of <i>Geoemyda
pulcherrima</i> from Mexcala in the Balsas Basin in northern Guerrero. On
the basis of this specimen it is highly probable that the species also
inhabits the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin in Michoac&aacute;n.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><b>Pseudemys scripta ornata</b> (Gray)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Emys ornata</i> Gray, Synopsis reptilium, p. 30,
1831.&mdash;Mazatl&aacute;n, Sinaloa, M&eacute;xico.</p>

<p><i>Pseudemys scripta ornata</i>, Carr, Herpetologica, 1:135,
December 30, 1938.</p></div>

<p>The systematics and distribution of <i>Pseudemys scripta</i> in M&eacute;xico and
Central America are poorly understood. Smith and Taylor (1950b:32)
recorded this turtle from the Pacific lowlands of Sinaloa, Jalisco,
Oaxaca, and Chiapas. This species is represented by vicarious
populations throughout the Atlantic lowlands of M&eacute;xico, northwestern
M&eacute;xico, over much of the United States, and also in Baja California.
Along the Pacific coast of M&eacute;xico the species seems to be extremely
rare, or, at least, only locally abundant. Since the species has such a
wide distribution, and since it occurs on the Pacific lowlands both to
the north and to the south of Michoac&aacute;n, it is reasonable to expect its
presence on the coast of Michoac&aacute;n. Inquiries among the natives living
in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin produced only negative evidence about
the occurrence of <i>Pseudemys</i> in the R&iacute;o Tepalcatepec and R&iacute;o Balsas. I
suspect that the best place to search for these turtles on the coast of
Michoac&aacute;n is in the numerous fresh-water lagoons on the coastal plain.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Caiman crocodilus fuscus</b> (Cope)</p>

<p><i>Caiman crocodilus fuscus</i>, Mertens, Senckenbergiana,
26:275, December 22, 1943.</p></div>

<p>Gadow (1930:50) reported that <i>Caiman sclerops</i> (= <i>Caiman crocodilus
fuscus</i>) inhabited the "tierra caliente" in Michoac&aacute;n. Smith and Taylor
(1950b:212) accepted Gadow's record for the State, although otherwise
the species is unknown north of Oaxaca. Peters (1954:10) refuted Gadow's
record on the basis that Gadow's collections contained no specimens of
<i>Caiman</i>. The local name "caiman" refers to both <i>Crocodylus</i> and to
<i>Caiman</i>, for, in general, the natives do not distinguish between the
two. "Caimanes" are reported from along the coast of Michoac&aacute;n, where
the name presumably refers to <i>Crocodylus acutus acutus</i>, and in the
Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin (Gadow, 1930:50; Webber, 1946:267). I have
seen no specimens of either <i>Crocodylus</i> or <i>Caiman</i> from the Balsas
Basin. If crocodilians do occur in the basin, they probably are
<i>Crocodylus acutus acutus</i>. There is no basis, whatsoever, for including
Michoac&aacute;n in the range of <i>Caiman crocodilus fuscus</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

(1950b:39).</p></div>

<p>Dug&egrave;s (1896:480) reported this species from Morelia, Michoac&aacute;n. Smith
and Taylor (1950b:39), who recorded the species from three localities in
the Balsas Basin in Guerrero, rejected Dug&egrave;s' record. I, too, am
unwilling to accept Dug&egrave;s' record. Nevertheless, the species probably
occurs throughout much of the Balsas Basin. This idea is strengthened by
comments made by Storm (1939:342): "The last hard drop, that afternoon,
was down the great Cerro de los Cajones [southwest of Tac&aacute;mbaro], and
here in the upper forest we came upon... a lizard with front legs and
none behind ... the animal with hands and no feet that se&ntilde;or Smith
[Hobart M. Smith] was seeking!... They're named <i>Bipes caniculatus</i>
(<i>sic.</i>)."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Coleonyx elegans nemoralis</i> Klauber, Trans. San Diego Soc.
Nat. Hist., 10:195, March 9, 1949.&mdash;Paso del R&iacute;o, Colima,
M&eacute;xico.</p></div>

<p>Klauber (1945:199) and Smith and Taylor (1950b:43) reported this lizard
from the coastal lowlands of Colima and Guerrero. Davis and Smith
(1953:101) reported it from 8 kilometers northeast of Temilpa, Morelos,
in the upper Balsas Basin. Specimens of this lizard have been collected
infrequently; the few locality records and limited ecological data
indicate that it inhabits dense scrub forest and tropical semi-deciduous
forest. <i>Coleonyx elegans nemoralis</i> is to be expected on the coastal
lowlands, the seaward foothills of the Sierra de Coalcom&aacute;n, and on the
lower slopes of the Cordillera Volc&aacute;nica along the northern edge of the
Tepalcatepec Valley.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Phrynosoma orbiculare orbiculare</b> (Linnaeus)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Lacerta obricularis</i> Linnaeus, Systema naturae, ed. 12,

(1950b:97).</p>

<p><i>Phrynosoma orbiculare orbiculare</i>, Smith, Trans. Kansas
Acad. Sci., 37:290, 1934.</p></div>

<p>Gadow (1905:213) inferred that <i>Phrynosoma orbiculare</i> occurred at
elevations of more than 3000 feet in Michoac&aacute;n. There are no specimens
of this species known from Gadow's collections made in Michoac&aacute;n. Smith
and Taylor (1950b:98) apparently accepted Gadow's statement and recorded
the species from Michoac&aacute;n: "above 3000 feet (Jorullo?)." Reeve
(1952:940) somehow misconstrued this statement to read "Jorullo, above
Zumpango (Smith and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> Taylor, 1950b)." Reeve did not indicate on his map
(1952:939) that the species occurred in Michoac&aacute;n. In the most recent
review of the species (Horowitz, 1955), no localities are given in
Michoac&aacute;n. Since <i>Phrynosoma orbiculare</i> is known from central Jalisco,
Guanajuato, Queretaro, and M&eacute;xico, its presence at least in northeastern
Michoac&aacute;n is to be expected, although at the present time there are no
specimens known from the state.</p>

<p>Smith and Taylor (1950b:168) Listed this species: "<i>Michoac&aacute;n</i>: No
specific record." I am unaware of any specimen of this skink from the
state. As presently recognized, this species contains two subspecies.
One of these occurs in the mountains of Oaxaca northward into central
Veracruz; the other, <i>Eumeces brevirostris bilineatus</i>, occurs in
Durango southward to Jalisco, where it inhabits the Sierra Madre
Occidental. Possibly the species occurs in the Sierra de los Tarascos in
Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Dug&eacute;s (1896) in a paper in which he listed several species of <i>Eumeces</i>
in M&eacute;xico, reported <i>Eumeces callicephalus</i> from Michoac&aacute;n, but he gave
no specific locality within the state. Michoac&aacute;n was included in the
range of the species by Taylor (1936:298) and by Smith and Taylor
(1950b:164). The species definitely is known from southeastern Arizona
southward to Guanajuato. It may occur in Michoac&aacute;n, but, since there are
three rather widespread species of <i>Eumeces</i> inhabiting the Mexican
Plateau and associated mountain ranges in the northern and northeastern
part of Michoac&aacute;n, interspecific competition might be a reason for the
absence of <i>Eumeces callicephalus</i> there.</p>

known from Michoac&aacute;n. Smith and Taylor (1945:87) listed the species as

<p>Dug&egrave;s (1896:480) reported a snake, questionably of this species, from
Uruapan, Michoac&aacute;n. Taylor (1940c) suggested that on geographic grounds
Dug&egrave;s' record might refer to <i>T. f. guerreroensis</i>, which is known
definitely only from the type locality. <i>Tropidodipsas occidentala</i> is
known from Comala, Colima, and Coalcom&aacute;n, Michoac&aacute;n. On zoogeopraphic
grounds that species might be found at Uruapan. Since the specimen
apparently no longer is extant, the identification cannot be
ascertained.</p>

<p>Smith and Taylor (1945:174) recorded the species from Zamora, Michoac&aacute;n.
Hobart M. Smith (<i>in litt.</i>) stated that this record was based on a
report of <i>Elaps fulvius</i> from Zamora by Dug&egrave;s (1896:482). Smith guessed
that the report was based on a specimen of <i>Micrurus fitzingeri</i>. The
specimen has not been seen. Although the species is known from
Guanajuato and M&eacute;xico, until a specimen is available from Michoac&aacute;n, the
species should not be considered part of the herpetofauna of Michoac&aacute;n.</p>

localities are arranged alphabetically according to the most definitive
word or words in the total name. For example, Lago de Chapala is listed
as "Chapala (Lago de)" and Cerro de Tanc&iacute;taro is listed as "Tanc&iacute;taro
(Cerro de)." Insofar as has been possible, the following information is
given for each locality: geographical co-ordinates to the nearest minute
of north latitude and west longitude, elevation in meters above mean sea
level, a description of its geographical location, type of dominant
vegetation, and in some cases comments concerning collecting sites in
the vicinity. Distances are in kilometers; all are map (air line)
distances, unless otherwise indicated. Many localities visited on mule
trips are given as being a certain number of "mule hours" in a general
direction from another town or village. In order to reach most of these
localities today, one would have to go by mule, and this is the way the
muleteers determine their distances. Some of the elevations are taken
from maps, but most of them were obtained from one or more readings of
altimeters that we carried in the field. The terms used for describing
the vegetation are those defined in the section of the natural

<h2><a name="SUMMARY" id="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h2>


<p>The preceding analysis of the amphibians and reptiles of the state of
Michoac&aacute;n shows that the herpetofauna is composed of 176 species and
subspecies definitely recorded from the state, plus ten others that
probably occur there. Ten species are reported for the first time from
Michoac&aacute;n: <i>Pseudoeurycea robertsi</i>, <i>Leptodactylus occidentalis</i>,
<i>Microbatrachylus pygmaeus</i>, <i>Pternohyla fodiens</i>, <i>Hypopachus
caprimimus</i>, <i>Phyllodactylus homolepidurus</i>, <i>Anolis dunni</i>, <i>Sceloporus
bulleri</i>, <i>Sceloporus heterolepis,</i> and <i>Geagras redimitus</i>. Five
species that have been reported previously from Michoac&aacute;n are based on
specimens having unreliable locality data or on misidentifications;
therefore, the following species are not considered to be a part of the
herpetofauna of Michoac&aacute;n: <i>Caiman crocodilus fuscus</i>, <i>Urosaurus
irregularis</i>, <i>Geophis nasalis</i>, <i>Tropidodipsas fasciata guerreroensis</i>,
and <i>Micrurus fitzingeri fitzingeri</i>.</p>

<p>Systematic studies based at least in part on specimens from Michoac&aacute;n
have resulted in a redefinition of nine species and subspecies: <i>Bufo
marmoreus</i>, <i>Bufo perplexus</i>, <i>Anolis nebulosus</i>, <i>Anolis nebuloides</i>,
<i>Sceloporus bulleri</i>, <i>Sceloporus heterolepis</i>, <i>Sceloporus melanorhinus
calligaster</i>, <i>Hypsiglena torquata torquata</i>, and <i>Hypsiglena torquata
ochrorhyncha</i>.</p>

<p>Nine species that previously have been recognized as valid have been
placed in synonymy. These are: <i>Bufo horribilis</i> Wiegmann, 1833, and
<i>Bufo angustipes</i> Smith and Taylor, 1945, as synonyms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> <i>Bufo marinus</i>
(Linnaeus), 1758. <i>Microbatrachylus albolabris</i> Taylor, 1940,
<i>Microbatrachylus minimus</i> Taylor, 1940, and <i>Microbatrachylus imitator</i>
Taylor, 1942, as synonyms of <i>Microbatrachylus pygmaeus</i> (Taylor), 1937.
<i>Phrynohyas corasterias</i> Shannon and Humphrey, 1957, as a synonym of
<i>Phrynohyas inflata</i> (Taylor), 1944. <i>Hyla microeximia</i> Maslin, 1957, as
a synonym of <i>Hyla eximia</i> Baird, 1854. <i>Hylella azteca</i> Taylor, 1943,
as a synonym of <i>Hyla smaragdina</i> Taylor, 1940. <i>Loxocemus sumichrasti</i>
Bocourt, 1876, as a synonym of <i>Loxocemus bicolor</i> Cope, 1861.
<i>Eleutherodactylus vocalis</i> Taylor, 1940, is considered to be a
subspecies of <i>Eleutherodactylus rugulosus</i>. The populations of
<i>Thamnophis dorsalis</i> in the Tepalcatepec Valley are shown to be
distinct from those inhabiting the highlands of the state; <i>Thamnophis
dorsalis postremus</i> Smith, 1942, is revived for the population in the
Tepalcatepec Valley.</p>

<p>Descriptions are given of the tadpoles of <i>Bufo occidentalis</i> and <i>Hyla
bistincta</i>.</p>
